# Mnemosyne - Emotional Memory System for AI

## What We're Building

Mnemosyne transforms years of message history into structured emotional memories that give AI agents the ability to have genuinely personal, relationship-aware conversations. Named after the Greek goddess of memory, it bridges the gap between cold AI interactions and warm, emotionally intelligent conversations.

## Core Value Proposition

**Problem**: Current AI systems are context-blind and memory-poor, creating cold, transactional interactions that reset with every conversation.

**Solution**: Mnemosyne extracts emotional intelligence from real conversations, creating structured memories that enable AI to understand relationship dynamics, emotional patterns, and personal history.

**Outcome**: AI conversations that feel genuinely personal - where Claude can reference shared emotional history, understand relationship patterns, and respond with appropriate warmth and context.

## Target Users

### Primary (MVP)

- **Internal Agent Systems**: Claude, GPT, and other AI agents that need emotional intelligence
- **Initial Users**: Nathan and Melanie, demonstrating relationship-aware AI interactions
- **Developers**: Building emotionally intelligent AI applications

### Future

- **Personal AI Assistants**: Individuals seeking deeper AI connections
- **Platform Integration**: Customer service, mental health, education applications
- **Enterprise**: Organizations enhancing customer experience with emotional intelligence

## Key Features
