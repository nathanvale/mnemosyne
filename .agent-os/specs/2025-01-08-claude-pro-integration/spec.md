# Spec Requirements Document

> Spec: Claude Pro Integration - Emotionally Weighted Prompts
> Created: 2025-01-08
> Status: Planning

## Overview

Implement a comprehensive Claude API integration for the @studio/memory package that leverages existing mood scoring and delta detection capabilities to create emotionally intelligent memory extraction. This integration will use the Anthropic TypeScript SDK to send mood-aware prompts to Claude, enabling sophisticated analysis of emotional context and relationship dynamics in conversations.

## User Stories

### Story 1: Developer Integrates Claude for Memory Extraction

As a developer, I want to configure Claude API integration with my existing mood scoring system, so that I can extract emotionally significant memories from conversations with high accuracy.

**Workflow:**

1. Developer sets up environment variables with Anthropic API key
2. Developer configures Claude client with appropriate rate limits and retry strategies
3. System validates API key and connection
4. Developer processes message batches through the enhanced pipeline
5. System filters messages by emotional salience using delta detection
6. System generates mood-aware prompts with emotional context
7. Claude processes prompts and returns structured memory data
8. System parses responses into ExtractedMemory format with confidence scores

### Story 2: System Administrator Monitors API Usage

As a system administrator, I want to monitor Claude API usage and costs, so that I can stay within budget and optimize processing efficiency.

**Workflow:**

1. Administrator configures rate limiting thresholds
2. System tracks API calls, tokens used, and costs
3. System provides real-time usage metrics through response headers
4. Administrator receives alerts when approaching limits
5. System automatically throttles requests when needed
6. Administrator can adjust batch sizes and processing priorities

### Story 3: Quality Assurance Engineer Tests Memory Extraction

As a QA engineer, I want to test the Claude integration with various emotional scenarios, so that I can ensure accurate memory extraction across different conversation types.

**Workflow:**

1. Engineer prepares test conversations with known emotional patterns
2. Engineer runs test suite with mocked Claude API responses
3. System validates prompt generation with mood context
4. System tests rate limiting and retry mechanisms
5. Engineer verifies memory extraction accuracy
6. System generates test coverage reports

## Spec Scope

1. **Claude Client Module** - Anthropic SDK initialization, authentication, and configuration
2. **Enhanced Prompt Builder** - Mood-aware prompt generation with emotional context integration
3. **Rate Limiter** - API usage management with exponential backoff and queue management
4. **Enhanced Claude Processor** - Integration layer connecting mood scoring to Claude API
5. **Response Parser** - Claude response parsing and validation against memory schema
6. **Error Handler** - Comprehensive error handling with retry logic and graceful degradation
7. **Configuration Manager** - Environment variables and runtime configuration
8. **Cost Estimator** - API usage cost calculation and budget tracking

## Out of Scope

- UI components for memory review (handled by @studio/validation)
- Database persistence layer (handled by @studio/db)
- User authentication and authorization
- Real-time streaming UI updates
- Custom Claude model fine-tuning
- Multi-language support (English only for MVP)

## Expected Deliverable

1. **Functional Claude Integration** - Working API connection with authentication
2. **Mood-Aware Processing** - Prompts enriched with emotional context and mood scores
3. **Rate Limit Management** - Robust handling of API limits with automatic retry
4. **High-Quality Memory Extraction** - >70% confidence in extracted memories
5. **Comprehensive Test Suite** - >80% code coverage with unit and integration tests
6. **Documentation** - API usage guide, configuration reference, and prompt engineering best practices
7. **Cost Optimization** - Efficient token usage with batch processing and caching
