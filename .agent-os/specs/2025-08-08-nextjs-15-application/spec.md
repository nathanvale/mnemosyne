# Next.js 15 Application Spec

> Spec: Next.js 15 Application with App Router
> Created: 2025-08-08
> Status: Completed Implementation

## Overview

Implement modern React application using Next.js 15 with App Router, React 19, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS 4. This application provides server-side rendering, API routes, image optimization, font optimization, and comprehensive development tooling through Storybook integration and testing infrastructure.

## User Stories

### Modern React Application Development

As a **frontend developer**, I want a modern React application framework so that I can build performant web applications with server-side rendering, automatic code splitting, and optimized production builds for superior user experience.

The application provides:

- Next.js 15 with App Router for file-based routing and server components
- React 19 with latest features including concurrent rendering and suspense
- TypeScript configuration with strict type checking and path aliases
- Production optimization with automatic code splitting and prefetching

### Integrated Development Environment

As a **UI developer**, I want integrated development tools so that I can develop, test, and document components efficiently with hot module replacement, Storybook integration, and comprehensive testing support.

The system supports:

- Storybook integration with Next.js for component development and documentation
- Vitest testing with React Testing Library for unit and integration tests
- MSW (Mock Service Worker) for API mocking during development and testing
- Hot module replacement with fast refresh for rapid development

### Styling and Design System

As a **designer-developer**, I want modern styling capabilities so that I can build responsive, accessible interfaces with utility-first CSS and custom font optimization for consistent brand experience.

The application enables:

- Tailwind CSS 4 with PostCSS for utility-first styling
- Google Fonts integration with Geist font family optimization
- Dark mode support with CSS variables and theme detection
- Responsive design with mobile-first breakpoints

## Spec Scope

### In Scope

**Core Next.js Configuration**:

- Next.js 15 setup with App Router and server components architecture
- TypeScript configuration extending centralized @studio/typescript-config
- Project references for monorepo package dependencies
- Environment configuration with development and production modes

**Application Structure**:

- App Router with src/app directory structure for pages and layouts
- Root layout with font optimization and global styles
- Page components with server-side rendering capabilities
- API route support with App Router conventions

**Development Tooling**:

- Storybook 9 with Next.js Vite integration for component development
- Vitest configuration for unit and integration testing
- MSW setup for API mocking with public worker directory
- Development server with hot module replacement

**Build and Deployment**:

- Production build optimization with Next.js compiler
- Static asset handling with public directory
- Image optimization with Next.js Image component
- TypeScript type checking and linting integration

**Testing Infrastructure**:

- React Testing Library for component testing
- Storybook test runner for visual testing
- Accessibility testing with Storybook a11y addon
- Browser testing with Playwright and Vitest browser mode

### Out of Scope

**Advanced Next.js Features**:

- Internationalization (i18n) routing and localization
- Advanced middleware configuration beyond defaults
- Custom server implementation or deployment targets
- Edge runtime or experimental features

**External Integrations**:

- Authentication providers or session management
- CMS integrations or content management
- E-commerce functionality or payment processing
- Third-party analytics or monitoring services

**Infrastructure Configuration**:

- Docker containerization or orchestration
- CDN configuration beyond Next.js defaults
- Custom caching strategies or headers
- Database connections or ORM setup (handled by @studio/db)

## Expected Deliverable

1. **Modern React application** - Verify Next.js 15 with App Router provides performant server-side rendering and client-side navigation
2. **Component development environment** - Ensure Storybook integration enables efficient UI development and documentation
3. **Comprehensive testing setup** - Validate testing infrastructure supports unit, integration, and visual testing
4. **Optimized production builds** - Confirm build process generates optimized bundles with code splitting and asset optimization
