# Technical Specification

This is the technical specification for the spec detailed in @.agent-os/specs/2025-08-08-mood-context-token-generation/spec.md

> Created: 2025-08-08
> Version: 1.0.0

## Technical Requirements

**MoodContextTokenizer Architecture**:

- Core tokenizer class in `packages/mcp/src/mood-context/tokenizer.ts` with configurable complexity levels
- Integration with `@studio/memory` for ExtractedMemory processing and mood analysis
- Configurable mood context generation supporting basic (3 descriptors), standard (trajectory), and detailed (comprehensive) modes
- Performance optimization with caching, batching, and relevance filtering for sub-200ms response times

**Context Assembly Integration**:

- Integration with `AgentContextAssembler` for comprehensive context building with mood token inclusion
- Mood trajectory calculation with direction analysis (improving, declining, stable, fluctuating) for emotional continuity
- Recent mood pattern identification with delta analysis and significance scoring for agent understanding
- Token budget management with configurable limits and relevance thresholds for optimal agent consumption

**Performance Optimization Framework**:

- Multi-level caching strategy with in-memory caching for repeated mood analysis and context generation
- Batched processing for multiple participants with shared computation optimization reducing processing overhead
- Relevance-based filtering with configurable thresholds (0.6-0.8) balancing context richness with performance
- Response time monitoring with performance analytics and cache hit rate tracking for optimization

**Agent Integration Preparation**:

- MCP resource definitions for mood context endpoints preparing for Phase 3 full MCP server implementation
- Context format optimization for agent consumption with structured emotional vocabulary and descriptor arrays
- Configuration presets (realtime, balanced, comprehensive) for different agent types and use cases
- Integration testing with mock agent scenarios validating context quality and performance characteristics

## Approach Options

**Tokenization Strategy** (Selected)

- **Configurable complexity levels with performance optimization**
- Pros: Flexible context generation, optimal performance for different use cases, scalable architecture
- Cons: Configuration complexity, multiple code paths to maintain
- **Rationale**: Agent integration requires different levels of emotional intelligence based on use case and performance requirements

**Alternative: Single complexity level**

- Pros: Simpler implementation, single code path, easier testing
- Cons: Not optimized for different agent requirements, performance issues for real-time use cases
- **Decision**: Configurable approach chosen to support diverse agent integration scenarios

**Caching Architecture** (Selected)

- **Multi-level caching with in-memory and component-level strategies**
- Pros: Excellent performance optimization, flexible invalidation, reduced computation overhead
- Cons: Memory usage considerations, cache coherency management
- **Rationale**: Agent integration requires sub-200ms response times necessitating aggressive caching

**Alternative: No caching with pure computation**

- Pros: Simple implementation, no cache management complexity
- Cons: Poor performance for agent integration, excessive computation overhead
- **Decision**: Multi-level caching essential for real-time agent performance requirements

## External Dependencies

**@studio/memory** - Memory processing and extraction utilities

- **Purpose**: Access to ExtractedMemory data structures and mood analysis capabilities
- **Justification**: Mood context generation requires processed emotional intelligence data from memory system

**@studio/schema** - TypeScript interfaces for emotional intelligence

- **Purpose**: Type safety for mood context structures and validation
- **Justification**: Complex emotional intelligence data requires proper type definitions and validation

**uuid (v4)** - Unique identifier generation for context tokens

- **Purpose**: Generating unique context tokens for agent consumption and caching
- **Justification**: Context token management requires unique identification for caching and tracking

**Node.js Performance Hooks** (conditional) - Performance monitoring

- **Purpose**: Response time monitoring and performance analytics for optimization
- **Justification**: Sub-200ms performance requirements necessitate detailed performance tracking
