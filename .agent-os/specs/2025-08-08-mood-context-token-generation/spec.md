# Mood Context Token Generation Spec

> Spec: Mood Context Token Generation for Agent Consumption
> Created: 2025-08-08
> Status: Completed Implementation

## Overview

Implement sophisticated mood context tokenization system that transforms complex emotional intelligence data into agent-ready context tokens with configurable complexity levels and performance optimization. This system provides AI agents with structured emotional context through mood tokens, trajectories, descriptors, and relevance-based filtering for authentic emotional understanding and appropriate response generation.

## User Stories

### Agent-Ready Mood Context Generation

As a **Claude agent integration system**, I want sophisticated mood context tokens so that I can provide AI agents with structured emotional intelligence enabling contextually appropriate and emotionally intelligent responses.

The system provides:

- `MoodContextTokenizer` with configurable complexity levels (basic, standard, detailed) for different agent requirements
- Current mood assessment with trajectory analysis and confidence scoring for reliable emotional understanding
- Mood descriptors and emotional vocabulary optimized for agent consumption and natural language generation
- Performance-optimized token generation with sub-200ms response times and multi-level caching strategy

### Configurable Emotional Context Assembly

As an **agent context system**, I want configurable mood context generation so that I can optimize emotional intelligence delivery based on agent type, conversation goals, and token budget constraints.

The system supports:

- Basic complexity (max 3 descriptors) for real-time agent responses requiring fast emotional context
- Standard complexity with trajectory analysis for balanced emotional intelligence and performance
- Detailed complexity with comprehensive emotional analysis for sophisticated agent interactions requiring deep understanding
- Token budget management with relevance filtering ensuring optimal context utilization within agent constraints

### Mood Trajectory and Pattern Recognition

As an **emotional continuity system**, I want mood trajectory analysis so that AI agents can understand emotional progression and respond appropriately to mood changes and patterns.

The system enables:

- Mood trajectory calculation with direction analysis (improving, declining, stable, fluctuating)
- Recent mood pattern identification with delta analysis and significance scoring
- Emotional baseline establishment with deviation analysis for context-aware agent responses
- Temporal mood analysis with trend identification for predictive emotional understanding

### Performance-Optimized Context Delivery

As a **real-time agent system**, I want performance-optimized mood context generation so that emotional intelligence doesn't compromise response time or user experience.

The system delivers:

- Multi-level caching strategy (in-memory, component-level) achieving 80%+ cache hit rates
- Sub-200ms context generation for real-time agent interactions with emotional intelligence
- Batched processing for multiple participants with shared computation optimization
- Configurable relevance thresholds balancing context richness with performance requirements

### Out of Scope

**Advanced AI Model Integration**:

- Direct integration with specific AI models beyond context token generation
- Model-specific prompt engineering or response optimization beyond context preparation
- Real-time model inference or embedded emotional intelligence models
- Advanced machine learning features beyond statistical mood analysis and pattern recognition

**Production Agent Infrastructure**:

- Full agent orchestration or conversation management beyond mood context provision
- Advanced agent workflow management or multi-agent coordination capabilities
- Real-time conversation streaming or live context updates requiring complex event management
- Enterprise agent features like audit logging or advanced security beyond basic context delivery

## Expected Deliverable

1. **Configurable mood context generation** - Verify tokenizer provides basic/standard/detailed complexity levels with appropriate performance characteristics
2. **Sub-200ms performance optimization** - Ensure mood context generation meets real-time agent requirements with caching achieving 80%+ hit rates
3. **Agent-ready context formatting** - Validate context tokens enable meaningful AI conversations with appropriate emotional understanding
4. **Integration preparation** - Confirm mood context integrates properly with agent context assembly and MCP foundation layer
