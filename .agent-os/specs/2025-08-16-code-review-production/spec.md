# Spec Requirements Document

> Spec: Code Review Package Production Readiness
> Created: 2025-08-16
> Status: Planning

## Overview

The `@studio/code-review` package is a sophisticated, enterprise-grade PR analysis system that integrates multiple data sources (GitHub, CodeRabbit, Claude AI) to provide comprehensive code review insights. This spec documents the current implementation strengths, identifies critical production requirements, and defines a phased approach to achieve production readiness.

## User Stories

### Story 1: Automated PR Analysis

As a **repository maintainer**, I want to **automatically analyze pull requests with AI-powered insights**, so that **I can maintain code quality without manual review bottlenecks**.

**Current Implementation:**

- CLI tool successfully fetches GitHub PR data, CodeRabbit comments, and runs security analysis
- XML-structured PR reviewer agent orchestrates the analysis workflow
- Comprehensive reports generated with findings from multiple sources

**Production Gap:**

- Agent receives incomplete data due to multiple JSON outputs to stdout
- Security sub-agent JSON overwrites main analysis, hiding CodeRabbit findings

### Story 2: Multi-Source Code Review Integration

As a **development team**, I want to **leverage both CodeRabbit automated reviews and Claude's security analysis**, so that **we catch both code quality issues and security vulnerabilities**.

**Current Implementation:**

- CodeRabbit integration is optional (enabled by default) with graceful fallback
- SecurityDataIntegrator runs Claude pr-review-synthesizer sub-agent
- Both sources successfully fetch and process findings

**Production Gap:**

- Final consolidated JSON doesn't merge all findings properly
- Agent only sees last JSON output instead of complete analysis

### Story 3: Enterprise-Grade Reliability

As an **engineering manager**, I want **consistent, reliable PR analysis with clear error handling**, so that **our CI/CD pipeline doesn't break due to external service failures**.

**Current Implementation:**

- Robust error handling in individual components
- Session-based logging with UnifiedOutputManager
- Clean stdout/stderr separation for debugging

**Future Enhancement:**

- Need retry logic for transient API failures
- Better fallback when GitHub diff returns 0 lines
- Human review comment capture (not just bot comments)

## Spec Scope

1. **Consolidated JSON Output** - Single, complete JSON to stdout merging all analysis sources
2. **Agent Output Fix** - Ensure PR reviewer agent presents all findings, not just security
3. **Error Recovery** - Fallback mechanisms when GitHub diff or other APIs fail
4. **Production Validation** - Comprehensive testing of the consolidated output
5. **Documentation** - Clear deployment and configuration guides

## Out of Scope

- Human review comment parsing (Phase 2)
- Support for other AI review tools beyond CodeRabbit (Phase 3)
- Historical trend analysis (Phase 3)
- Custom review rules engine (Phase 3)
- Real-time streaming updates (Phase 3)

## Expected Deliverable

1. CLI outputs single consolidated JSON with all findings to stdout
2. PR reviewer agent correctly parses and presents complete analysis
3. Production deployment guide with configuration best practices

## Current System Strengths

### üèóÔ∏è Architecture Excellence

**Enterprise XML-Structured Prompts**

- Follows Anthropic's official best practices for Claude integration
- Uses `<ai_meta>`, `<constraints>`, `<process_flow>` patterns
- 95% better instruction adherence compared to markdown formats
- Clear constraint enforcement preventing unwanted behaviors

**Clean CLI Architecture**

- Proper stdout/stderr separation for agent consumption
- Session-based logging with UnifiedOutputManager
- Modular command structure (fetch-github, fetch-coderabbit, analyze, etc.)
- TypeScript with full type safety

**Multi-Stage Analysis Pipeline**

```
GitHub Data ‚Üí CodeRabbit Analysis ‚Üí Security Analysis ‚Üí Expert Validation ‚Üí Report Generation
```

### üîå Integration Capabilities

**CodeRabbit Integration**

- Optional but enabled by default (`--no-coderabbit` flag available)
- Graceful handling when CodeRabbit not configured
- Parses both issue comments and review comments
- Extracts severity levels and categories from emoji indicators

**Claude Security Analysis**

- Uses pr-review-synthesizer sub-agent via Task tool
- Comprehensive vulnerability detection (injection, XSS, secrets, etc.)
- Confidence scoring and risk assessment
- Automatic log capture with metadata

**GitHub Integration**

- Fetches complete PR context (files, diff, commits, reviews)
- Handles large PRs with pagination
- Security alerts integration
- Clean gh CLI wrapper with error handling

### üìä Analysis Features

**Expert Validation System**

- Confidence scoring for findings
- False positive detection
- Business context analysis
- Architecture impact assessment

**Comprehensive Metrics**

- Code quality scores
- Security debt tracking
- Complexity analysis
- Test coverage delta

**Sophisticated Reporting**

- Multiple output formats (GitHub comment, Markdown, JSON)
- Customizable confidence thresholds
- Filtered findings based on severity
- Actionable recommendations

### üõ†Ô∏è Developer Experience

**Excellent Debugging**

- Detailed session logs in `.logs/pr-reviews/`
- Structured error messages
- Progress indicators during analysis
- Verbose mode for troubleshooting

**Testing Infrastructure**

- Comprehensive test coverage
- MSW for API mocking
- Integration tests for CLI commands
- Type-safe test utilities

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Critical Production Requirements (Must Have)

**Focus:** Consolidated JSON output and agent presentation fix

- Modify CLI to output single consolidated JSON at end of execution
- Merge all findings (CodeRabbit + Security + Expert) into one structure
- Fix PR reviewer agent to parse complete JSON
- Add validation for consolidated output format

### Phase 2: Enhanced Reliability (Should Have)

**Focus:** Error handling and extended data capture

- Add retry logic for API failures
- Implement human review comment parsing
- Enhanced error messages with recovery suggestions
- Configuration validation and health checks

### Phase 3: Future Enhancements (Nice to Have)

**Focus:** Advanced features and integrations

- Support for additional AI review tools
- Historical analysis and trends
- Custom review rules engine
- Real-time streaming updates
