## Test Coverage

### Critical Business Logic Tests (3 tests - High Priority)

**Position-based significance weighting test**

- Location: `delta-history-tracking.test.ts:line-reference-pending`
- Issue: Precision error in significance calculation (expected 4.29 > 4.32)
- Fix: Adjust position weight calculation to ensure conclusion position gets proper boost
- Validation: Verify calculation matches expected algorithm behavior

**Delta pattern retrieval test**

- Location: `delta-history-tracking.test.ts:line-reference-pending`
- Issue: Pattern count mismatch (expected 2 patterns but got 1)
- Fix: Ensure proper pattern creation and association in test setup
- Validation: Verify pattern storage and retrieval logic

**Turning point retrieval test**

- Location: `delta-history-tracking.test.ts:line-reference-pending`
- Issue: Turning point count mismatch (expected 2 but got 1)
- Fix: Implement proper turning point creation in test data
- Validation: Verify temporal ordering and significance ranking

### Infrastructure Tests (12 tests - Medium Priority)

**Foreign key constraint violation fixes**

- Location: 7 tests across multiple files
- Issue: Creating MoodScore records without Memory parent
- Fix: Implement Memory creation before MoodScore in all test scenarios
- Validation: All foreign key relationships properly established

**Missing memory record fixes**

- Location: 2 tests in schema-optimization.test.ts
- Issue: DeltaHistoryStorageService validation failing for non-existent Memory
- Fix: Create Memory records before calling storeDeltaHistory
- Validation: Memory existence validation passes

**Module import fixes**

- Location: performance-analysis.test.ts:14
- Issue: Importing CalibrationSystem but module exports AlgorithmCalibrationManager
- Fix: Correct import to match actual export name
- Validation: Constructor instantiation succeeds

**Mock class shadowing fixes**

- Location: delta-history-tracking.test.ts:4 vs :86
- Issue: Local mock class shadows real import
- Fix: Rename mock to MockDeltaHistoryStorageService
- Validation: No naming conflicts between imports and mocks

**Test suite setup fixes**

- Location: 4 performance test suites
- Issue: Setup failures preventing test execution
- Fix: Implement proper database state initialization
- Validation: All test suites can initialize successfully

### Integration Tests

**Cross-service integration**

- Test complete mood analysis workflow from Memory creation through MoodScore storage
- Validate service boundaries and data consistency
- Verify transaction rollback on failures

**Performance test enablement**

- Re-enable 59 skipped performance tests systematically
- Validate <2 second response time requirements
- Test concurrent analysis scenarios

**Database consistency validation**

- Test referential integrity across all mood analysis tables
- Validate cascade deletion behavior
- Test concurrent operation safety

### Mocking Requirements

**Database mocking strategy**

- Use real Prisma client with in-memory SQLite for integration tests
- Mock external services only (Claude API, external validation)
- Avoid mocking internal business logic

**Service mocking patterns**

- Create interface-based mocks for service boundaries
- Use dependency injection for mockable services
- Implement test doubles that match production behavior

**Performance test mocking**

- Mock time-based operations for deterministic performance tests
- Use controlled datasets for consistent performance measurements
- Mock external API calls to eliminate network variability

## Test Health Metrics

### Immediate Targets (Week 1-2)

- Critical business logic: 100% passing (3/3 tests)
- Foreign key violations: 0 failures
- Module import errors: 0 failures

### Short Term (Month 1)

- Overall pass rate: 95%+ (target 373/393 passing)
- Skipped tests: <10% (target <40 skipped)
- Performance tests: 90%+ passing and enabled

### Long Term (Month 3)

- Test coverage: Maintain 90%+ per vitest.config.ts requirements
- Test stability: <1% flaky tests
- Build time: <30 seconds for complete test suite
- Zero skipped tests except documented exceptions
