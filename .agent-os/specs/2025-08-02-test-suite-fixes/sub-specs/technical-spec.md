# Technical Specification

This is the technical specification for the spec detailed in @.agent-os/specs/2025-08-02-test-suite-fixes/spec.md

> Created: 2025-08-02
> Version: 1.0.0

## Technical Requirements

### Foreign Key Constraint Resolution
- Implement Memory record creation before MoodScore record creation in all test scenarios
- Add transaction-based test data setup to ensure referential integrity
- Create proper cleanup sequences that respect cascade deletion order
- Validate Memory existence before creating dependent records in test scenarios

### Mock Strategy Cleanup
- Rename local mock classes to avoid shadowing real imports (e.g., MockDeltaHistoryStorageService)
- Implement proper mock isolation to prevent conflicts with actual implementations
- Ensure clear separation between test mocks and production imports
- Use TypeScript namespacing to prevent class name collisions

### Module Import/Export Corrections
- Fix CalibrationSystem vs AlgorithmCalibrationManager naming discrepancies
- Ensure export names match import statements across all test files
- Validate module resolution in test environment matches production environment
- Add TypeScript strict checking for import/export consistency

### Test Data Factory Implementation
- Create centralized test data factories that respect foreign key dependencies
- Implement proper setup order: Memory → MoodScore → MoodFactor → Deltas
- Add cleanup utilities that handle cascade deletions properly
- Provide reusable test data generators for performance tests

### Performance Test Infrastructure
- Systematically analyze and fix setup failures in 4 performance test suites
- Implement proper database state management for performance test isolation
- Add timeout handling for long-running performance tests
- Create performance baseline establishment utilities

## Approach Options

**Option A:** Incremental Fix Approach
- Pros: Lower risk, can fix tests one by one, easier to validate changes
- Cons: Slower progress, may miss systemic issues, could introduce inconsistencies

**Option B:** Comprehensive Infrastructure Overhaul (Selected)
- Pros: Addresses root causes, creates reusable patterns, fixes all related issues systematically
- Cons: Larger scope, requires more upfront design, higher initial complexity

**Rationale:** Option B selected because the test failures indicate systemic infrastructure issues rather than isolated bugs. The foreign key constraint violations, mock conflicts, and module import errors all stem from fundamental test setup patterns that need comprehensive fixing. A systematic approach will prevent similar issues in future test development and create a robust foundation for Phase 2 mood scoring algorithm validation.

## External Dependencies

**No new external dependencies required** - All fixes can be implemented using existing tools:
- Vitest for test framework (already configured)
- Prisma for database operations (already integrated)
- TypeScript for type checking (already enforced)
- Existing @studio/db package for database access
