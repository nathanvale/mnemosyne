# Technical Specification

This is the technical specification for the spec detailed in @.agent-os/specs/2025-08-08-relational-timeline-construction/spec.md

> Created: 2025-08-08
> Version: 1.0.0

## Technical Requirements

**RelationalTimelineBuilder Architecture**:

- Core timeline builder in `packages/mcp/src/relational-timeline/builder.ts` with configurable time windows and event limits
- Integration with `@studio/memory` for ExtractedMemory processing and emotional pattern analysis
- Timeline construction supporting week/month/quarter/year time windows with configurable event limits (20-50 events)
- Delta pattern detection with recovery/decline/plateau/oscillation classification and confidence assessment

**Temporal Event Processing**:

- Chronological event extraction from memory collections with timestamp sorting and significance scoring
- Key moment identification with turning points, breakthroughs, setbacks, and relationship milestones
- Event filtering by time windows with temporal relevance assessment and significance thresholds
- Timeline coherence validation ensuring meaningful emotional sequence and chronological consistency

**Relationship Evolution Analysis**:

- Cross-participant interaction tracking with relationship dynamics evolution over time
- Communication pattern analysis with interaction quality progression and emotional safety assessment
- Relationship milestone detection with closeness changes, conflict resolution, and support effectiveness
- Participant-scoped timeline views with individual relationship perspective and interaction history

**Agent Integration and Performance**:

- Timeline querying with configurable filters for participant focus, time ranges, and significance levels
- Timeline summarization optimized for agent consumption with emotional significance weighting
- Integration with `AgentContextAssembler` for comprehensive context building with temporal intelligence
- Performance optimization with caching and batched processing for multiple participant timeline requests

## Approach Options

**Timeline Construction Strategy** (Selected)

- **Memory-based chronological construction with significance filtering**
- Pros: Accurate temporal ordering, configurable complexity, significance-based relevance
- Cons: Requires processed memory data, complex significance calculation
- **Rationale**: Agent integration requires chronologically accurate emotional intelligence with configurable depth

**Alternative: Simple chronological sorting**

- Pros: Faster processing, simpler implementation
- Cons: No significance assessment, poor relevance for agents
- **Decision**: Significance-based approach chosen for meaningful agent emotional intelligence

**Delta Pattern Detection** (Selected)

- **Statistical analysis with pattern classification and confidence scoring**
- Pros: Reliable pattern identification, confidence assessment, meaningful emotional transitions
- Cons: Complex calculation, requires sufficient data for accuracy
- **Rationale**: Emotional progression understanding crucial for agent context and appropriate responses

**Alternative: Simple mood comparison**

- Pros: Fast computation, simple implementation
- Cons: No pattern recognition, limited emotional intelligence
- **Decision**: Statistical pattern detection essential for sophisticated emotional intelligence

**Time Window Management** (Selected)

- **Configurable time windows with relevance filtering**
- Pros: Flexible agent integration, performance optimization, relevance control
- Cons: Configuration complexity, multiple filtering strategies
- **Rationale**: Different agent types require different temporal scopes for optimal emotional context

## External Dependencies

**@studio/memory** - Memory processing and extraction utilities

- **Purpose**: Access to ExtractedMemory data structures and emotional pattern analysis
- **Justification**: Timeline construction requires processed emotional intelligence data with pattern analysis

**@studio/schema** - TypeScript interfaces for emotional intelligence

- **Purpose**: Type safety for timeline structures, emotional events, and relationship dynamics
- **Justification**: Complex temporal emotional intelligence data requires proper type definitions

**uuid (v4)** - Unique identifier generation for timeline events and patterns

- **Purpose**: Generating unique IDs for timeline events and delta patterns
- **Justification**: Timeline event management and pattern tracking require unique identification

**date-fns** (conditional) - Date manipulation and formatting utilities

- **Purpose**: Time window calculation, date filtering, and temporal analysis
- **Justification**: Sophisticated timeline construction requires robust date handling and time window management
