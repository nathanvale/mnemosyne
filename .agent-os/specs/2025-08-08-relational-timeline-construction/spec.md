# Relational Timeline Construction Spec

> Spec: Relational Timeline Construction for Emotional Event Tracking
> Created: 2025-08-08
> Status: Completed Implementation

## Overview

Implement sophisticated relational timeline construction system that transforms extracted memories into chronological emotional event sequences with relationship evolution tracking and key moment identification. This system provides AI agents with temporal emotional intelligence through structured timelines, delta pattern detection, and participant-scoped relationship dynamics for authentic emotional continuity and context-aware responses.

## User Stories

### Chronological Emotional Event Construction

As a **temporal analysis system**, I want sophisticated timeline construction capabilities so that I can organize emotional memories into meaningful chronological sequences with relationship evolution tracking and emotional significance assessment.

The system provides:

- `RelationalTimelineBuilder` with configurable time windows (week, month, quarter, year) and event limits for optimal agent consumption
- Chronological emotional event extraction with timestamps, significance scoring, and relationship context for temporal understanding
- Key moment identification with emotional turning points and relationship milestones for important event highlighting
- Participant-scoped timeline views with individual relationship evolution and interaction pattern tracking

### Delta Pattern Detection and Analysis

As an **emotional progression system**, I want delta pattern detection capabilities so that AI agents can understand emotional transitions, mood repair moments, and relationship evolution patterns for appropriate response generation.

The system supports:

- Delta pattern identification with recovery sequences, decline patterns, plateau breaks, and oscillation cycles
- Emotional transition analysis with magnitude assessment and significance scoring for pattern understanding
- Mood repair moment detection identifying emotional recovery and support effectiveness for relationship insights
- Temporal pattern recognition with confidence assessment and duration analysis for reliable pattern identification

### Relationship Evolution Tracking

As a **relationship dynamics system**, I want relationship evolution tracking so that AI agents can understand how interpersonal dynamics change over time and respond appropriately to relationship contexts.

The system enables:

- Cross-participant interaction tracking with relationship dynamics evolution and communication pattern changes
- Relationship milestone identification with closeness changes, conflict resolution, and support moments
- Communication pattern evolution with interaction quality assessment and emotional safety progression
- Participant-specific relationship timeline views with individual perspective and interaction history

### Agent-Optimized Timeline Output

As a **agent integration system**, I want performance-optimized timeline construction so that emotional intelligence timelines enhance agent responses without compromising performance or exceeding token budgets.

The system delivers:

- Timeline querying and filtering capabilities for agent context selection with relevance-based prioritization
- Timeline summarization optimized for agent consumption with emotional significance weighting
- Configurable event limits and time windows balancing emotional intelligence depth with performance requirements
- Integration with mood context and vocabulary extraction for comprehensive agent context assembly
