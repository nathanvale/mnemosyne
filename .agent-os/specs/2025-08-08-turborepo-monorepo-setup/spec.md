# Turborepo Monorepo Setup Spec

> Spec: Turborepo Monorepo Setup with Intelligent Caching
> Created: 2025-08-08
> Status: Completed Implementation

## Overview

Implement high-performance monorepo build system using Turborepo with intelligent caching, optimized task pipelines, dependency management, and comprehensive environment configuration. This system provides enterprise-grade build orchestration through parallel task execution, incremental builds, remote caching capabilities, and sophisticated dependency tracking for scalable multi-package development workflows.

## User Stories

### High-Performance Build Orchestration

As a **development team**, I want high-performance build orchestration so that I can develop and build multiple packages efficiently with intelligent caching and parallel execution for optimal development velocity and CI/CD performance.

The system provides:

- Turborepo configuration with intelligent caching achieving 100% cache hits on unchanged code
- Parallel task execution with dependency-aware scheduling maximizing CPU utilization
- Incremental builds with precise input/output tracking for minimal rebuild times
- Task pipeline configuration with build, test, lint, type-check, and format orchestration

### Intelligent Dependency Management

As a **package maintainer**, I want sophisticated dependency management so that I can ensure correct build order and efficient rebuilds with automatic dependency tracking and topological task ordering for reliable multi-package builds.

The system supports:

- Automatic dependency detection with `^build` syntax for upstream package builds
- Topological task ordering ensuring dependencies build before dependents
- Selective execution with `--filter` flags for targeted package operations
- Workspace protocol integration with pnpm for internal package dependencies

### Environment Configuration and Caching

As a **DevOps engineer**, I want comprehensive environment configuration so that I can manage build environments consistently with proper cache invalidation and environment variable handling for reproducible builds across environments.

The system enables:

- Global environment variable management with 74 configured environment variables
- Global dependencies tracking with automatic cache invalidation on config changes
- Pass-through environment variables for test workers and CI environments
- Cache-aware environment handling with proper cache key generation

### Developer Experience Optimization

As a **developer**, I want optimized developer experience so that I can work efficiently with fast feedback loops, persistent development servers, and intelligent cache utilization for productive development workflows.

The system delivers:

- Persistent development tasks with hot module replacement and fast refresh
- Cache-optimized test execution with worker ID pass-through for parallel testing
- Format and lint caching with incremental checking on changed files only
- Database operation tasks with proper input tracking for migration management

## Spec Scope

### In Scope

**Core Turborepo Configuration**:

- Task pipeline configuration with dependency-aware execution and topological ordering
- Intelligent caching system with input/output tracking and cache key generation
- Global dependencies management with automatic invalidation on configuration changes
- Environment variable configuration with 74 variables for comprehensive control

**Task Pipeline Orchestration**:

- Build pipeline with `^build` dependencies ensuring correct package build order
- Test pipeline with build dependencies and environment variable pass-through
- Lint pipeline with cached execution and incremental file checking
- Type-check pipeline with TypeScript build dependencies and tsbuildinfo caching

**Caching and Performance Optimization**:

- Input specification with src files, configs, and package.json tracking for precise cache keys
- Output specification with build artifacts and generated files for cache storage
- Cache configuration with task-specific caching strategies and invalidation rules
- Persistent tasks for development servers with cache bypass for live development

**Development and CI/CD Integration**:

- Development server orchestration with persistent tasks and hot reload support
- CI environment integration with proper environment variable handling
- Test worker support with Wallaby, Vitest, and Jest worker ID pass-through
- Storybook integration with build dependencies and test coordination

**Database and Import Operations**:

- Database reset, push, and migrate tasks with Prisma schema tracking
- Database studio task with persistent execution for development
- Message import task with build dependencies for data processing
- Clean task for artifact removal and cache clearing

### Out of Scope

**Advanced Turborepo Features**:

- Remote caching setup beyond local caching configuration
- Turborepo Cloud integration or remote cache providers
- Custom task runners or plugin development beyond configuration
- Advanced pipeline visualization or dependency graph generation

**Enterprise Features**:

- Multi-tenant caching strategies beyond current single-team setup
- Advanced access control for cache management
- Distributed build orchestration across multiple machines
- Custom metrics or telemetry beyond Turborepo defaults

**Complex Build Scenarios**:

- Cross-repository dependencies beyond current monorepo scope
- Dynamic task generation based on runtime conditions
- Advanced conditional execution beyond current filter capabilities
- Custom build orchestration logic beyond Turborepo configuration

## Expected Deliverable

1. **High-performance build execution** - Verify Turborepo provides intelligent caching with optimal cache hit rates and parallel execution
2. **Correct dependency ordering** - Ensure task pipeline maintains proper build order with topological sorting and dependency tracking
3. **Environment configuration reliability** - Validate environment variables and global dependencies provide consistent builds across environments
4. **Developer experience optimization** - Confirm development workflows benefit from caching and persistent tasks for productive development
