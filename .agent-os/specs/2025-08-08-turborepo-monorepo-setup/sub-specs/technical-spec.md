# Technical Specification

This is the technical specification for the spec detailed in @.agent-os/specs/2025-08-08-turborepo-monorepo-setup/spec.md

> Created: 2025-08-08
> Version: 1.0.0

## Technical Requirements

**Turborepo Configuration Architecture**:

- Core configuration in `turbo.json` with JSON schema validation and comprehensive task definitions
- Task pipeline orchestration with dependency resolution using `^` prefix for upstream dependencies
- Global dependencies tracking with tsconfig files and environment files for cache invalidation
- Environment variable management with 74 global environment variables for comprehensive control

**Task Pipeline Configuration**:

- Build tasks with `dependsOn: ["^build"]` for topological ordering and correct dependency resolution
- Input specification with source files, configs, and Prisma schemas for accurate cache key generation
- Output specification with .next, dist, build, and generated directories for artifact caching
- Cache configuration with task-specific strategies including persistent and cache-disabled tasks

**Caching System Implementation**:

- Intelligent cache key generation based on file inputs, environment variables, and dependencies
- Cache storage with local file system caching and potential for remote cache integration
- Cache invalidation with automatic detection of input changes and dependency updates
- Cache performance optimization with 100% cache hit rates on unchanged code

**Development Workflow Integration**:

- Development server tasks with `persistent: true` and `cache: false` for live development
- Test execution with environment variable pass-through for worker processes (Wallaby, Vitest, Jest)
- Storybook integration with build dependencies and dedicated test tasks
- Database operations with Prisma schema tracking and migration management

## Approach Options

**Build System Selection** (Selected)

- **Turborepo with intelligent caching and dependency management**
- Pros: Intelligent caching, parallel execution, dependency tracking, minimal configuration
- Cons: Learning curve, cache debugging complexity, dependency on Turborepo
- **Rationale**: Monorepo requires sophisticated build orchestration with caching for performance

**Alternative: Nx monorepo**

- Pros: More features, computation caching, affected commands, visualization tools
- Cons: Heavier setup, steeper learning curve, more opinionated structure
- **Decision**: Turborepo chosen for simplicity and performance focus

**Alternative: Lerna with custom scripts**

- Pros: Simple, well-established, flexible scripting
- Cons: No intelligent caching, manual dependency management, slower builds
- **Decision**: Turborepo provides superior performance with caching

**Caching Strategy** (Selected)

- **File-based caching with comprehensive input/output tracking**
- Pros: Precise cache invalidation, optimal performance, reproducible builds
- Cons: Configuration complexity, cache size management, debugging challenges
- **Rationale**: Maximum performance requires accurate dependency and file tracking

## External Dependencies

**turbo** - Build system for monorepos

- **Purpose**: Task orchestration, intelligent caching, and dependency management
- **Justification**: Core requirement for monorepo build performance and developer experience

**pnpm** - Package manager with workspace support

- **Purpose**: Efficient package management with workspace protocol and dependency deduplication
- **Justification**: Optimal for monorepo with efficient disk usage and fast installations

**Environment Configuration**:

- **74 Global Environment Variables**: Comprehensive configuration for all aspects of the build system
- **Claude Hooks Variables**: 40+ variables for Claude integration and developer experience
- **Build Variables**: NODE_ENV, CI, DATABASE_URL for environment-specific builds
- **Test Variables**: Worker IDs for parallel test execution across different test runners
