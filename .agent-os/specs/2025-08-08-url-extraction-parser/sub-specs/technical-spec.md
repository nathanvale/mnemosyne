# Technical Specification

This is the technical specification for the spec detailed in @.agent-os/specs/2025-08-08-url-extraction-parser/spec.md

> Created: 2025-08-08
> Version: 1.0.0

## Technical Requirements

**URL Extraction Engine Architecture**:

- Core extraction functionality in `packages/scripts/src/extract-urls.ts` with TypeScript interfaces
- Regex-based URL detection supporting HTTP(S) protocols and www. prefixed URLs with comprehensive pattern matching
- Text content parsing with robust link extraction handling various message formats and embedded URLs
- URL validation with format checking, protocol verification, and basic accessibility validation for quality assurance

**URL Processing and Normalization Framework**:

- Automatic URL normalization converting www. prefixes to https:// format for consistent link storage
- Protocol standardization with http to https conversion where appropriate for security consistency
- URL canonicalization with parameter sorting, fragment handling, and trailing slash normalization
- Case normalization with domain name standardization and path preservation for reliable comparison

**Link Deduplication System**:

- Case-insensitive URL comparison with normalized URL matching for duplicate elimination
- Duplicate link consolidation with reference counting and usage tracking for analytics insights
- Link relationship preservation with message associations and temporal tracking for audit trails
- Deduplication statistics with duplicate elimination rates and processing efficiency metrics

**Database Integration Framework**:

- Link table population with proper schema mapping and foreign key relationship management to Message records
- Message-link associations with bidirectional relationship tracking for comprehensive link analysis
- Batch processing with transaction management and error handling for reliable database operations
- Database constraint handling with conflict resolution and referential integrity maintenance

## Approach Options

**URL Detection Strategy** (Selected)

- **Regex-based URL extraction with comprehensive pattern matching**
- Pros: Fast processing, no external dependencies, reliable pattern matching, handles various URL formats
- Cons: May miss edge cases, requires pattern maintenance, limited semantic understanding
- **Rationale**: URL extraction requires reliable pattern detection with good performance for batch processing

**Alternative: NLP-based link detection**

- Pros: Better context understanding, handles natural language references
- Cons: Computational complexity, external dependencies, slower processing, overkill for URL detection
- **Decision**: Regex chosen for performance and reliability with clear URL patterns

**URL Normalization Approach** (Selected)

- **Multi-stage normalization with protocol standardization and case handling**
- Pros: Consistent URL format, reliable deduplication, maintains URL validity
- Cons: Processing overhead, potential for over-normalization, complex edge cases
- **Rationale**: Message URLs require consistent format for reliable deduplication and analysis

**Alternative: Minimal normalization**

- Pros: Preserves original URLs, faster processing, fewer edge cases
- Cons: Poor deduplication effectiveness, inconsistent formats, difficult analysis
- **Decision**: Comprehensive normalization chosen for data quality and analytics

**Database Storage Strategy** (Selected)

- **Dedicated Link table with foreign key relationships to Message records**
- Pros: Proper relational modeling, referential integrity, efficient queries, scalable design
- Cons: Additional table complexity, join requirements for queries, storage overhead
- **Rationale**: Link analysis requires proper relational structure for comprehensive analytics

## External Dependencies

**Node.js url** - URL parsing and manipulation utilities

- **Purpose**: URL validation, parsing, and normalization operations
- **Justification**: Reliable URL processing requires standard library support for parsing and validation

**@studio/db** - Database client and Prisma operations

- **Purpose**: Link table operations, message relationships, and transaction management
- **Justification**: URL extraction requires database integration for link storage and relationship management

**@studio/scripts** - Message processing utilities and batch operations

- **Purpose**: Message content parsing and batch processing infrastructure
- **Justification**: URL extraction integrates with existing message processing pipeline for efficiency

**TypeScript** - Type safety and interface definitions

- **Purpose**: Type definitions for URL structures, extraction results, and database operations
- **Justification**: URL processing operations require strong typing for data integrity and reliability
