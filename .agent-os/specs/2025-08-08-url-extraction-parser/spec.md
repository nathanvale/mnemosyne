# URL Extraction Parser Spec

> Spec: URL Extraction Parser with Automatic Link Detection
> Created: 2025-08-08
> Status: Completed Implementation

## Overview

Implement sophisticated URL extraction parser that automatically detects, normalizes, and processes links from message content with comprehensive validation, deduplication, and relationship management. This system provides reliable link detection capabilities through regex-based extraction, URL normalization, database integration, and comprehensive link analytics for enhanced message content analysis and relationship tracking.

## User Stories

### Automatic Link Detection and Extraction

As a **message processing system**, I want sophisticated URL extraction capabilities so that I can automatically identify and extract links from message content with comprehensive validation and normalization for reliable link analysis.

The system provides:

- Regex-based URL detection supporting http(s) protocols and www. prefixed URLs with comprehensive pattern matching
- Automatic URL normalization converting www. prefixes to https:// format for consistent link storage
- Text content scanning with robust extraction handling various message formats and embedded links
- Link validation with URL format checking and accessibility verification for quality assurance

### Link Deduplication and Management

As a **data quality system**, I want intelligent link deduplication capabilities so that I can eliminate duplicate links while preserving link relationships and maintaining comprehensive link analytics.

The system supports:

- Case-insensitive URL deduplication with normalized comparison and duplicate elimination
- Link relationship management with foreign key associations to source messages for complete audit trails
- URL canonicalization with parameter normalization and fragment handling for reliable comparison
- Duplicate link consolidation with usage tracking and reference counting for analytics insights

### Database Integration and Storage

As a **data persistence system**, I want seamless database integration so that extracted links are properly stored with message relationships and referential integrity for comprehensive link analysis.

The system enables:

- Link table population with proper foreign key relationships to Message records for complete data modeling
- Batch link processing with transaction management and error handling for reliable data storage
- Message-link relationship tracking with bidirectional associations for comprehensive link analysis
- Database constraint handling with conflict resolution and data integrity validation

### Link Analytics and Reporting

As a **analytics system**, I want comprehensive link analytics capabilities so that I can analyze link patterns, track link usage, and generate insights about communication patterns and content sharing.

The system delivers:

- Link usage statistics with extraction counts, message associations, and sharing pattern analysis
- URL domain analysis with top domains identification and link categorization for content insights
- Link processing performance metrics with extraction rates and processing efficiency measurement
- Message enrichment statistics with link density analysis and content enhancement tracking
