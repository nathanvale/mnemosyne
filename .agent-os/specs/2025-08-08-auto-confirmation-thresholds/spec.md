# Spec Requirements Document

> Spec: Auto-Confirmation with Confidence Thresholds
> Created: 2025-08-08
> Status: Completed - All implementation finished
> Implementation Location: packages/validation/src/

## Overview

Implement auto-confirmation functionality with confidence thresholds for the smart validation system that automatically validates memories with high confidence (>0.75) while flagging uncertain cases (0.50-0.75) for review and rejecting low-quality memories (<0.50), dramatically reducing manual validation burden while maintaining 95%+ accuracy.

## User Stories

### Smart Auto-Confirmation System

As a memory validation specialist, I want the system to automatically approve high-confidence memories (>0.75), so that I can focus my attention on uncertain cases rather than reviewing obvious approvals.

The system calculates multi-factor confidence combining Claude confidence (40%), emotional coherence (30%), relationship accuracy (20%), and context quality (10%), then routes memories based on thresholds. Auto-approved memories are immediately confirmed without human review, while borderline cases (0.50-0.75) are flagged for focused validation with rich context showing confidence breakdowns and uncertainty areas.

### Intelligent Threshold Management

As a system administrator, I want configurable confidence thresholds that continuously optimize based on validation accuracy, so that the auto-confirmation system maintains high accuracy while maximizing automation.

The threshold manager tracks user validation decisions versus auto-confirmation predictions, implementing weekly optimization based on false positive/negative rates. The system supports A/B testing of different threshold strategies and provides personalized calibration for individual validator preferences.

### Quality Assurance and Monitoring

As a project manager, I want comprehensive monitoring of auto-confirmation performance with alerts for accuracy drops, so that I can ensure the system maintains quality standards while scaling validation operations.

The monitoring dashboard tracks auto-confirmation rates, accuracy metrics, false positive/negative rates, and provides detailed analytics on confidence factor contributions. Alert systems notify administrators of significant accuracy drops or quality issues requiring intervention.

## Spec Scope

1. **Multi-Factor Confidence Calculator** - Calculate overall confidence combining Claude confidence, emotional coherence, relationship accuracy, and context quality with weighted scoring
2. **Threshold-Based Decision Router** - Route memories to auto-approve (>0.75), review queue (0.50-0.75), or auto-reject (<0.50) based on confidence scores
3. **Continuous Calibration System** - Track validation accuracy and optimize thresholds weekly based on user feedback and system performance
4. **Batch Processing Engine** - Process large volumes of memories efficiently with progress tracking and quality distribution monitoring
5. **Integration with Validation Package** - Seamlessly integrate with @studio/validation package for auto-confirmation workflow

## Out of Scope

- Manual validation interface (handled by existing validation system)
- Memory extraction functionality (handled by existing extraction system)
- Emotional significance scoring (separate feature in issue #89)
- Advanced machine learning models (future enhancement)

## Expected Deliverable

1. Auto-confirmation system achieves 70%+ automation rate with 95%+ accuracy across different memory types and validation scenarios
2. Confidence threshold management provides configurable thresholds with continuous optimization and A/B testing capabilities
3. Comprehensive monitoring dashboard shows real-time auto-confirmation performance, accuracy trends, and quality distribution analytics
