# Technical Specification

This is the technical specification for the spec detailed in @.agent-os/specs/2025-08-08-auto-confirmation-thresholds/spec.md

> Created: 2025-08-08
> Version: 1.0.0

## Technical Requirements

- Multi-factor confidence calculation with weighted scoring (Claude: 40%, Emotional: 30%, Relationship: 20%, Context: 10%)
- Threshold-based decision routing system with configurable boundaries (>0.75 auto-approve, 0.50-0.75 review, <0.50 auto-reject)
- Continuous calibration engine that optimizes thresholds based on validation accuracy feedback
- Batch processing capability handling 1000+ memories per minute with progress tracking
- Integration with existing @studio/validation package for seamless workflow
- Real-time monitoring dashboard with accuracy metrics and performance analytics
- Alert system for accuracy drops below 95% threshold
- A/B testing framework for threshold optimization strategies

## Approach Options

**Option A:** Centralized Auto-Confirmation Service

- Pros: Single service handles all auto-confirmation logic, easier to maintain, centralized monitoring
- Cons: Potential bottleneck, single point of failure, less flexible for different validation contexts

**Option B:** Distributed Auto-Confirmation Engine (Selected)

- Pros: Scalable architecture, modular components, can be embedded in different validation contexts, better performance
- Cons: More complex architecture, requires coordination between components

**Rationale:** Option B provides better scalability and flexibility for integration with existing validation workflows while maintaining performance requirements.

## External Dependencies

- **@studio/validation** - Core validation package for integration with auto-confirmation workflow
- **Justification:** Required for seamless integration with existing validation system and memory processing
- **@studio/memory** - Memory data structures and operations
- **Justification:** Needed for confidence factor extraction and memory quality assessment
- **@studio/db** - Database operations for storing confidence scores and calibration data
- **Justification:** Required for persistence of threshold settings and performance tracking

## Architecture Components

### ConfidenceCalculator

Calculates overall confidence score by combining multiple factors:

- Claude confidence score from validation response
- Emotional coherence score based on sentiment consistency
- Relationship accuracy score from relationship extraction quality
- Context quality score from surrounding message context

### ThresholdManager

Manages confidence thresholds and optimization:

- Configurable threshold boundaries (auto-approve, review, auto-reject)
- Weekly optimization based on validation accuracy feedback
- A/B testing framework for threshold strategies
- User-specific calibration for personalized validation

### AutoConfirmationEngine

Main orchestrator for auto-confirmation decisions:

- Evaluates memories using ConfidenceCalculator
- Routes decisions based on ThresholdManager settings
- Provides confidence breakdowns and reasoning explanations
- Handles batch processing with progress tracking

### CalibrationSystem

Continuous learning and optimization:

- Tracks user validation decisions vs auto-confirmation predictions
- Calculates false positive/negative rates
- Optimizes thresholds based on accuracy targets
- Provides feedback loop for system improvement

### MonitoringDashboard

Real-time performance monitoring:

- Auto-confirmation rates and accuracy metrics
- Confidence factor distribution analysis
- Threshold effectiveness visualization
- Alert system for quality issues

## Performance Requirements

- Process 1000+ memories per minute in batch mode
- Maintain <100ms response time for individual memory evaluation
- Achieve 95%+ accuracy in auto-confirmation decisions
- Support concurrent processing for multiple validation workflows
- Provide real-time monitoring with <5 second data refresh
