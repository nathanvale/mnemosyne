# CSV Message Import System Spec

> Spec: CSV Message Import System with Deduplication and Progress Tracking
> Created: 2025-08-08
> Status: Completed Implementation

## Overview

Implement comprehensive CSV message import system that transforms raw message data into structured database storage with robust error handling, progress tracking, and content-based deduplication. This system provides reliable data ingestion capabilities through SHA-256 content hashing, duplicate detection, batch processing optimization, and comprehensive error reporting for large-scale message dataset processing.

## User Stories

### Robust CSV Data Import

As a **data processing system**, I want sophisticated CSV import capabilities so that I can reliably ingest large message datasets with comprehensive error handling, validation, and progress tracking for operational visibility.

The system provides:

- CSV parsing with flexible schema support handling timestamp, sender, senderId, message, and assets columns
- Comprehensive error handling with row-level error tracking and detailed error reporting for debugging
- Progress tracking with processed/imported/skipped counters and real-time import status for operational monitoring
- Graceful error recovery with continued processing after individual row failures and comprehensive error summaries

### Content-Based Deduplication

As a **data integrity system**, I want SHA-256 content hashing for deduplication so that I can eliminate duplicate messages while preserving data integrity and import efficiency.

The system supports:

- SHA-256 content hash generation based on timestamp, sender, senderId, message, and assets for reliable deduplication
- Import session tracking preventing duplicate imports within single session with hash set management
- Database-level duplicate detection with unique constraint enforcement and conflict resolution
- Deduplication statistics with duplicate count tracking and ~40% duplicate elimination rate achievement

### Batch Processing Optimization

As a **performance-critical system**, I want efficient batch processing capabilities so that I can handle large message datasets with optimal memory usage and processing performance.

The system enables:

- Streaming CSV processing with memory-efficient row-by-row processing avoiding large dataset memory overhead
- Batch database operations with transaction management and commit optimization for performance
- Progress monitoring with real-time statistics and processing rate calculation for operational insight
- Resource optimization with configurable batch sizes and memory management for scalable processing

### Database Integration and Storage

As a **data persistence system**, I want seamless database integration so that imported messages are properly stored with relationship management and referential integrity.

The system delivers:

- Prisma ORM integration with type-safe database operations and automatic relationship management
- Message table storage with proper field mapping and data type conversion for structured storage
- Foreign key relationship management with Link and Asset table population for comprehensive data storage
- Transaction management with rollback capabilities and atomic operations for data consistency

## Spec Scope

### In Scope

**Core CSV Import Engine**:

- CSV parsing with fast-csv integration supporting flexible schema and encoding handling
- Row-by-row processing with validation, transformation, and error handling for robust data ingestion
- Command-line interface with configurable options and progress display for operational use
- Import session management with duplicate tracking and statistics reporting for monitoring

**Content Hashing and Deduplication**:

- SHA-256 content hash generation with stable, deterministic hashing algorithm for reliable deduplication
- Import session hash tracking preventing duplicate processing within single import operation
- Database duplicate detection with unique constraint handling and conflict resolution strategies
- Deduplication metadata tracking with hash collision handling and merge history preservation

**Error Handling and Recovery**:

- Comprehensive error tracking with row-level error capture and detailed error reporting
- Graceful error recovery with continued processing after individual failures and batch error aggregation
- Error classification with validation errors, database errors, and processing errors for debugging
- Error reporting with detailed summaries and actionable error messages for operational troubleshooting

**Progress Tracking and Monitoring**:

- Real-time progress updates with processed/imported/skipped counters and processing rate calculation
- Import statistics with deduplication rates, error counts, and performance metrics for analysis
- CLI progress display with formatted output and real-time status updates for user feedback
- Processing time measurement with performance benchmarking and optimization insights

**Database Integration and Storage**:

- Prisma client integration with type-safe database operations and transaction management
- Message table population with proper field mapping and data validation for structured storage
- Relationship management with Link and Asset table integration for comprehensive data modeling
- Database transaction handling with commit/rollback logic and atomic operations for consistency

### Out of Scope

**Advanced Data Processing Features**:

- Complex data transformation beyond basic field mapping and validation
- Advanced schema inference or dynamic column mapping beyond fixed message schema
- Real-time import monitoring or live dashboard features beyond CLI progress tracking
- Advanced data validation beyond basic field presence and type checking

**Production Deployment Features**:

- Import scheduling or automated import workflows beyond manual CLI execution
- Advanced monitoring integration or alerting systems beyond basic error reporting
- Multi-user import coordination or concurrent import management systems
- Enterprise audit logging or compliance features beyond basic import tracking

**Data Export and Transformation**:

- Export functionality or data transformation beyond import processing
- Advanced data formats beyond CSV input support
- Integration with external data sources beyond file-based CSV import
- Advanced data analytics or reporting beyond import statistics

## Expected Deliverable

1. **Robust CSV import processing** - Verify import system handles large datasets with comprehensive error handling and graceful failure recovery
2. **Content deduplication effectiveness** - Ensure SHA-256 hashing achieves ~40% duplicate elimination with reliable content-based detection
3. **Progress tracking and monitoring** - Validate real-time progress updates and comprehensive statistics provide operational visibility
4. **Database integration reliability** - Confirm seamless Prisma integration with proper relationship management and data consistency
