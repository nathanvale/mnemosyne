# Technical Specification

This is the technical specification for the spec detailed in @.agent-os/specs/2025-08-08-csv-message-import-system/spec.md

> Created: 2025-08-08
> Version: 1.0.0

## Technical Requirements

**CSV Import Architecture**:

- Core import functionality in `packages/scripts/src/import-messages.ts` with Commander.js CLI interface
- Fast-CSV integration for streaming CSV parsing with memory-efficient row-by-row processing
- SHA-256 content hashing with Node.js crypto module for deterministic deduplication
- Prisma client integration with type-safe database operations and transaction management

**Content Hashing and Deduplication**:

- Stable content hash generation combining timestamp, sender, senderId, message, and assets fields
- Import session hash tracking with Set-based duplicate detection within single import operation
- Database unique constraint enforcement with graceful duplicate handling and conflict resolution
- Deduplication statistics tracking with processed/imported/skipped counters and duplicate rate calculation

**Error Handling and Recovery**:

- Comprehensive error tracking with row-level error capture and detailed error context
- Error classification with validation errors, database constraint violations, and processing exceptions
- Graceful error recovery with continued processing after individual row failures
- Error aggregation with detailed error summaries and actionable troubleshooting information

**CLI Interface and Progress Tracking**:

- Commander.js CLI with configurable file path, debug mode, and processing options
- Real-time progress updates with formatted output and processing statistics
- Import summary reporting with deduplication rates, error counts, and performance metrics
- Debug mode with detailed logging and verbose error reporting for troubleshooting

## Approach Options

**CSV Processing Strategy** (Selected)

- **Streaming row-by-row processing with fast-csv**
- Pros: Memory efficient for large files, real-time progress tracking, graceful error handling
- Cons: Slightly slower than bulk loading, more complex error handling
- **Rationale**: Large message datasets require memory-efficient processing with comprehensive error recovery

**Alternative: Bulk CSV loading**

- Pros: Faster processing, simpler implementation
- Cons: High memory usage, poor error recovery, no progress tracking
- **Decision**: Streaming approach chosen for scalability and operational visibility

**Deduplication Strategy** (Selected)

- **SHA-256 content hashing with database unique constraints**
- Pros: Cryptographically reliable, deterministic, database-enforced uniqueness
- Cons: Additional computational overhead, storage requirements
- **Rationale**: Message deduplication requires reliable content-based identification for data integrity

**Alternative: Simple string comparison**

- Pros: Faster processing, no hashing overhead
- Cons: Less reliable, no collision resistance, poor performance with large datasets
- **Decision**: SHA-256 chosen for reliability and collision resistance

## External Dependencies

**fast-csv** - High-performance CSV parsing library

- **Purpose**: Streaming CSV parsing with schema validation and error handling
- **Justification**: Large CSV files require memory-efficient streaming processing with comprehensive error recovery

**Commander.js** - Command-line interface framework

- **Purpose**: CLI argument parsing, help generation, and command structure
- **Justification**: Professional CLI interface with configurable options and user-friendly help

**@studio/db** - Database client and schema definitions

- **Purpose**: Type-safe database operations with Prisma integration
- **Justification**: Database integration requires type safety and transaction management

**@studio/logger** - Structured logging utilities

- **Purpose**: Progress tracking, error reporting, and debug logging
- **Justification**: Import operations require comprehensive logging for monitoring and troubleshooting

**Node.js crypto** - Cryptographic hashing functions

- **Purpose**: SHA-256 content hash generation for deduplication
- **Justification**: Content-based deduplication requires reliable cryptographic hashing
