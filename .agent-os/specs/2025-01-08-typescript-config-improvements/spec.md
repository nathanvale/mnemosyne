> Spec: Complete TypeScript Configuration Improvements
> Created: 2025-01-08
> Status: Planning

## Overview

Implement comprehensive TypeScript configuration improvements to complete GitHub issue #101, following Turborepo best practices for optimal performance and maintainability in our monorepo architecture.

## User Stories

### Developer Productivity Story

As a developer working in the mnemosyne monorepo, I want a centralized and consistent TypeScript configuration across all packages, so that I can maintain code quality without managing duplicate configurations.

When working across multiple packages, developers currently face inconsistent TypeScript settings and duplicated configuration logic. This centralized approach will eliminate configuration drift and reduce maintenance overhead by providing a single source of truth for TypeScript compiler options.

### Performance Optimization Story

As a developer running type checks frequently, I want parallel type checking with optimized caching, so that I can get faster feedback during development without waiting for sequential builds.

The current sequential type checking approach creates bottlenecks in the development workflow. By implementing transit nodes and parallel execution strategies recommended by Turborepo, we can achieve up to 50% faster type checking, significantly improving developer velocity.

### Build Simplification Story

As a package maintainer, I want to use Just-in-Time compilation patterns for library packages, so that I can eliminate unnecessary build steps and reduce complexity.

Library packages currently compile TypeScript to JavaScript even though consuming applications could handle this compilation. By adopting the Just-in-Time pattern where libraries export TypeScript source directly, we eliminate redundant compilation steps and simplify the build pipeline.

## Spec Scope

1. **Enhance @studio/typescript-config Package** - Add test configuration, optimize base settings, and prepare for Just-in-Time compilation pattern
2. **Migrate Legacy Package Configurations** - Convert 9 packages from old shared configuration to centralized typescript-config
3. **Standardize Outlier Packages** - Bring claude-hooks and other custom configurations in line with monorepo standards
4. **Implement Just-in-Time Compilation** - Configure library packages to export TypeScript source directly
5. **Optimize Type Checking Pipeline** - Add transit nodes and parallel execution for faster type checking

## Out of Scope

- Migration to different TypeScript versions
- Changes to ESLint or Prettier configurations
- Modifications to runtime behavior or application logic
- Changes to deployment or CI/CD pipelines
- Conversion from ES modules to CommonJS or vice versa

## Expected Deliverable

1. All 14 packages using centralized TypeScript configuration from @studio/typescript-config
2. Type checking completing 50% faster through parallel execution with measurable performance metrics
3. Zero build time for library packages with Just-in-Time compilation working in all consuming applications
