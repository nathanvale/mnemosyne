## Overview

Implement emotional significance weighting in validation decisions to prioritize review attention based on memory importance rather than chronological order. This system ensures that emotionally significant memories receive appropriate human attention while routine interactions can be processed more efficiently.

## User Stories

### Critical Memory Validation

As a validation system, I want to identify and prioritize emotionally significant memories, so that critical emotional moments receive appropriate human review while routine interactions are processed efficiently.

The system evaluates memories across multiple significance factors including emotional intensity, relationship impact, life event significance, participant vulnerability, and temporal importance. Each memory receives a weighted significance score that determines its priority in the validation queue.

### Priority-Based Review Queue

As a human validator, I want to review memories ordered by emotional significance rather than chronologically, so that I can focus my attention on the most important memories first.

The priority queue manager creates prioritized lists with review context, focus areas, and validation hints for each memory. It optimizes queue ordering based on available resources and validator expertise levels.

### Resource Optimization

As a system administrator, I want validation resources allocated based on emotional significance, so that critical memories receive more review time while maintaining efficiency for routine interactions.

The optimization system implements multiple strategies including high-significance focus, balanced sampling, and significance-weighted selection based on resource constraints and queue characteristics.

## Spec Scope

1. **Multi-Factor Significance Scoring** - Calculate emotional significance using 5 weighted factors (emotional intensity 30%, relationship impact 25%, life event significance 20%, participant vulnerability 15%, temporal importance 10%)

2. **Priority Queue Management** - Create prioritized memory lists with review context, focus areas, and validation hints based on significance scores

3. **Queue Optimization Strategies** - Implement adaptive optimization strategies (high-significance focus, balanced sampling, significance-weighted) based on resource constraints

4. **Review Context Generation** - Provide detailed review reasoning, focus areas, and validation hints for each prioritized memory

5. **Performance Analytics** - Track emotional range coverage, temporal span, and participant diversity metrics for optimization effectiveness

## Out of Scope

- Visual dashboard interface for monitoring (analytics exist but no UI)
- Machine learning model training for significance prediction
- Real-time significance score updates during validation
- Integration with external emotion detection APIs

## Expected Deliverable

1. Multi-factor emotional significance scoring with 5 weighted factors producing overall scores (0.0-1.0)
2. Priority-based memory ordering with detailed review context for human validators
3. Resource-optimized queue management supporting 3+ optimization strategies
4. Comprehensive analytics for queue effectiveness and coverage metrics
