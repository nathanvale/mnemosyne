> Implementation Status: ✅ COMPLETE

## Acceptance Criteria Verification

### ✅ Emotional Significance Scoring

#### ✅ Multi-dimensional significance assessment

**Implementation**: `weighter.ts:44-74`

- Combines 5 factors: emotional salience, relationship impact, life events, vulnerability, temporal importance
- Each factor calculated independently then combined with weights

#### ✅ Calculate significance scores (0-1 scale, normalized from 1-10)

**Implementation**: `weighter.ts:408-430`

- Produces scores from 0.0 to 1.0 (implementation uses 0-1 internally)
- Weighted average of all factors ensures normalized output

#### ✅ Support contextual significance evaluation

**Implementation**: `weighter.ts:155-403`

- Considers conversation type via emotional themes
- Evaluates participant relationships and roles
- Analyzes communication patterns and interaction quality

#### ✅ Provide significance confidence scoring

**Implementation**: `weighter.ts:61-64`

- Returns overall score with factor breakdown
- Narrative explanation provides confidence context
- Error handling assigns default low significance with explanation

### ✅ Significance-Adjusted Thresholds

#### ✅ Lower auto-approval thresholds for critical significance

**Implementation**: `priority-manager.ts:159-178`

- Critical memories (>0.9) flagged as "Critical emotional memory requiring careful validation"
- Review context emphasizes need for human review

#### ✅ Standard thresholds with priority flagging

**Implementation**: `priority-manager.ts:113-143`

- High significance (>0.8) generates specific focus areas
- Validation hints guide reviewers to important aspects

#### ✅ Standard thresholds for medium significance

**Implementation**: `priority-manager.ts:194-200`

- Medium defined as 0.4-0.7 significance score
- Normal review process with standard context

#### ✅ Relaxed thresholds for low significance

**Implementation**: `priority-manager.ts:194-200`

- Low significance (<0.4) allows for efficiency optimization
- Can be filtered out in high-significance-focus strategy

### ✅ Priority-Based Review Queue

#### ✅ Order review queue by emotional significance

**Implementation**: `priority-manager.ts:34`

- Sorts memories by significance score (descending)
- Assigns priority rank based on sorted position

#### ✅ Implement priority categories

**Implementation**: `priority-manager.ts:183-204`

- High: ≥0.7 significance
- Medium: 0.4-0.7 significance
- Low: <0.4 significance
- Distribution tracked for optimization

#### ✅ Provide estimated review time allocation

**Implementation**: `priority-manager.ts:209-221`

- Expert: 3 minutes per memory
- Intermediate: 5 minutes per memory
- Beginner: 8 minutes per memory
- Total time calculated in optimization

#### ✅ Support priority queue optimization

**Implementation**: `priority-manager.ts:53-88`

- Optimizes based on available time and validator expertise
- Applies strategy selection for best resource use

### ✅ Significance Factor Analysis

#### ✅ Analyze emotional salience

**Implementation**: `weighter.ts:155-190`

- Evaluates mood intensity (0-1 scale)
- Counts secondary emotions for complexity
- Identifies significant emotional themes

#### ✅ Evaluate relationship impact

**Implementation**: `weighter.ts:195-233`

- Assesses interaction quality levels
- Identifies significant communication patterns
- Considers group dynamics (>2 participants)

#### ✅ Assess context uniqueness

**Implementation**: `weighter.ts:238-291`

- Detects rare life events via tags
- Searches for significant keywords in content
- Accumulates score for multiple indicators

#### ✅ Determine validation urgency

**Implementation**: `weighter.ts:357-403`

- Recent memories (≤30 days) get higher priority
- Special dates increase importance
- Weekend memories considered for family significance

### ✅ Resource Allocation Optimization

#### ✅ Allocate more review time for significant memories

**Implementation**: `priority-manager.ts:269-315`

- High-significance-focus strategy prioritizes critical memories
- Balanced sampling ensures coverage across levels
- Time allocation proportional to significance

#### ✅ Optimize validation resource distribution

**Implementation**: `priority-manager.ts:226-264`

- Strategy selection based on queue characteristics
- Available time constraints considered
- Validator expertise affects time estimates

#### ✅ Provide quality assurance focus

**Implementation**: `priority-manager.ts:109-154`

- Focus areas highlight critical aspects
- Validation hints guide reviewer attention
- Review reasons explain priority

#### ✅ Balance efficiency with attention

**Implementation**: `priority-manager.ts:282-308`

- Balanced sampling strategy for diverse coverage
- Significance-weighted default for general cases
- Time-limited optimization for constrained resources

### ✅ Integration with Validation System

#### ✅ Integrate with @studio/validation package

**Implementation**: `packages/validation/src/index.ts`

- Factory function `createSignificanceWeighter()` exported
- All types exported for external use
- Seamless integration with validation workflow

#### ✅ Support auto-confirmation engine integration

**Implementation**: Ready for integration

- Significance scores can adjust confidence thresholds
- Priority queues feed into review workflow
- Shared TypeScript interfaces enable integration

#### ✅ Enhance smart review queue

**Implementation**: `priority-manager.ts:20-48`

- Creates prioritized memory lists
- Provides review context for each memory
- Tracks significance distribution

#### ✅ Enable validation analytics

**Implementation**: `priority-manager.ts:320-404`

- Emotional range coverage metrics
- Temporal span analysis
- Participant diversity tracking
- Expected quality calculations
