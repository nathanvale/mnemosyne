# Technical Specification

This is the technical specification for the spec detailed in @.agent-os/specs/2025-08-08-content-deduplication-engine/spec.md

> Created: 2025-08-08
> Version: 1.0.0

## Technical Requirements

**Deduplication Engine Architecture**:

- Core deduplication functionality in `packages/scripts/src/memory-deduplication.ts` with TypeScript interfaces
- SHA-256 content hashing with Node.js crypto module for deterministic hash generation
- Memory similarity analysis with configurable thresholds and classification algorithms
- Integration with memory processing pipeline for batch deduplication operations

**Content Hashing Framework**:

- Deterministic hash generation based on memory summary, participants array, source message IDs, and confidence scores
- Hash content normalization with consistent field ordering and data serialization for reliable comparison
- Content hash storage in memory records with unique constraint enforcement for duplicate prevention
- Hash collision handling with cryptographic reliability and edge case management

**Similarity Analysis System**:

- Content comparison algorithms with configurable similarity thresholds (0.0-1.0 scale)
- Duplicate classification with exact match detection, similar content identification, and no-match determination
- Similarity scoring with confidence assessment and decision rationale for merge recommendations
- Fuzzy matching capabilities with content analysis and contextual similarity assessment

**Memory Merging Operations**:

- Memory consolidation with content merging and metadata preservation across duplicate memories
- Participant data merging with role analysis and relationship consolidation for comprehensive memory reconstruction
- Source message aggregation with temporal ordering and context preservation for complete audit trails
- Deduplication metadata tracking with merge history, timestamps, and decision rationale

## Approach Options

**Content Hashing Strategy** (Selected)

- **SHA-256 cryptographic hashing with deterministic content serialization**
- Pros: Cryptographically reliable, collision-resistant, deterministic across systems
- Cons: Computational overhead, storage requirements for hash values
- **Rationale**: Memory deduplication requires reliable content identification with cryptographic guarantee

**Alternative: Simple string comparison**

- Pros: Faster processing, no hash computation overhead
- Cons: Poor collision resistance, inefficient for large datasets, no semantic understanding
- **Decision**: SHA-256 chosen for reliability and scalability with large memory collections

**Similarity Analysis Approach** (Selected)

- **Configurable threshold-based similarity with fuzzy matching**
- Pros: Flexible duplicate detection, configurable sensitivity, good performance
- Cons: Requires threshold tuning, may miss complex semantic similarity
- **Rationale**: Balance between detection accuracy and computational efficiency for large-scale processing

**Alternative: Advanced NLP semantic analysis**

- Pros: Better semantic understanding, higher accuracy for complex content
- Cons: Computational complexity, external dependencies, slower processing
- **Decision**: Threshold-based approach chosen for performance and reliability

**Memory Merging Strategy** (Selected)

- **Intelligent merging with metadata preservation and audit trails**
- Pros: Complete information preservation, comprehensive audit capability, data integrity
- Cons: Complex merge logic, storage overhead for metadata, potential conflicts
- **Rationale**: Memory data requires complete preservation with full audit capability

## External Dependencies

**Node.js crypto** - Cryptographic hashing functions

- **Purpose**: SHA-256 hash generation for content-based deduplication
- **Justification**: Reliable content hashing requires cryptographically secure algorithms

**@studio/memory** - Memory data structures and operations

- **Purpose**: Memory object definitions and processing utilities
- **Justification**: Deduplication engine requires access to memory data structures and validation

**@studio/db** - Database client and transaction management

- **Purpose**: Hash storage, duplicate detection queries, and merge operations
- **Justification**: Deduplication requires database integration for hash storage and conflict resolution

**TypeScript** - Type safety and interface definitions

- **Purpose**: Type definitions for memory structures, deduplication metadata, and operation results
- **Justification**: Complex deduplication operations require strong typing for data integrity
