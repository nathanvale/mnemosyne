# Content Deduplication Engine Spec

> Spec: Content Deduplication Engine with SHA-256 Hashing
> Created: 2025-08-08
> Status: Completed Implementation

## Overview

Implement sophisticated content deduplication engine that eliminates ~40% duplicate memories through advanced SHA-256 hashing, similarity analysis, and intelligent merge strategies. This system provides reliable duplicate detection capabilities through content-based hashing, metadata preservation, conflict resolution, and deduplication analytics for optimal memory storage efficiency and data integrity.

## User Stories

### Content-Based Duplicate Detection

As a **memory storage system**, I want sophisticated content deduplication capabilities so that I can eliminate duplicate memories while preserving data integrity and maintaining comprehensive merge history for audit and recovery purposes.

The system provides:

- SHA-256 content hashing with deterministic hash generation based on memory summary, participants, source messages, and confidence levels
- Exact duplicate detection with hash collision handling and cryptographic reliability for precise duplicate identification
- Similar content analysis with configurable similarity thresholds and fuzzy matching for near-duplicate detection
- Merge metadata preservation with original hash tracking and merge history for complete audit trails

### Intelligent Memory Merging

As a **data quality system**, I want intelligent memory merging capabilities so that I can combine similar memories while preserving essential information and maintaining data quality standards.

The system supports:

- Memory merging with confidence score preservation and metadata combination for comprehensive data retention
- Participant data consolidation with role analysis and relationship preservation across merged memories
- Source message aggregation with temporal ordering and context preservation for complete memory reconstruction
- Quality-based merge decisions with confidence thresholds and validation criteria for optimal merge outcomes

### Similarity Analysis and Classification

As a **content analysis system**, I want sophisticated similarity analysis so that I can classify duplicate types and make informed merge decisions based on content similarity and contextual relevance.

The system enables:

- Similarity scoring with configurable algorithms and threshold management for flexible duplicate detection
- Duplicate classification (exact, similar, none) with confidence scoring and decision rationale
- Content comparison with semantic analysis and contextual similarity assessment for intelligent classification
- Merge recommendation system with automated decision-making and manual review queue for complex cases

### Deduplication Analytics and Reporting

As a **data management system**, I want comprehensive deduplication analytics so that I can monitor deduplication effectiveness, optimize merge strategies, and maintain data quality standards.

The system delivers:

- Deduplication statistics with duplicate rates, merge success rates, and processing performance metrics
- Memory storage efficiency analysis with space savings calculation and storage optimization insights
- Merge quality assessment with confidence tracking and validation accuracy measurement
- Analytics dashboard with deduplication trends, merge patterns, and system performance monitoring
