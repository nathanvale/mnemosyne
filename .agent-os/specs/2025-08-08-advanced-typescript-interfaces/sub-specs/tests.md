## Test Coverage

### Type Definition Validation Tests

**Interface Completeness Tests**

- Verify Memory interface includes all emotional intelligence fields with proper typing
- Validate EmotionalContext interface supports full mood analysis with nested theme objects
- Test RelationshipDynamics interface handles complex participant data with measurement scales
- Ensure ValidationWorkflow interface covers all workflow states with proper enum constraints

**Type Constraint Validation**

- Confidence scores properly constrained to 1-10 integer range for Memory confidence field
- Mood intensity values properly constrained to 1-10 scale with proper type validation
- Relationship measurement scales (closeness, tension, supportiveness) enforce 1-10 range constraints
- Quality metrics maintain 0-1 float constraints with proper boundary validation

### Zod Schema Integration Tests

**Schema-Interface Alignment**

- MemorySchema validation aligns perfectly with Memory TypeScript interface
- EmotionalContextSchema validates all emotional context fields with proper nested object validation
- RelationshipDynamicsSchema handles complex participant dynamics with proper constraint checking
- ValidationResultSchema maintains consistency with TypeScript interface field requirements

**Runtime Validation Accuracy**

- Schema validation correctly identifies missing required fields with specific error messages
- Invalid field values generate appropriate validation errors with field-level detail
- Nested object validation properly validates emotional themes and contextual events
- Array field validation correctly handles participants and emotional markers

### Type Guard Function Tests

**Type Narrowing Functionality**

- isMemory() properly narrows unknown types to Memory interface with full property access
- isEmotionalContext() correctly identifies EmotionalContext objects with nested theme validation
- isRelationshipDynamics() validates complex relationship data with participant array checking
- isParticipant() correctly validates individual participant objects with role enum validation

**Runtime Type Checking**

- Type guards correctly reject invalid objects with proper false return values
- Partial object validation properly handles optional fields without false negatives
- Nested object type checking validates emotional themes and markers with proper depth
- Array element validation correctly validates participant arrays and emotional marker arrays

### Data Transformation Tests

**Database Transformation**

- transformMemoryForDatabase() maintains type safety while converting to Prisma-compatible format
- Database transformation properly serializes JSON fields (participants, themes, markers)
- Transformation functions handle optional fields correctly without data loss
- Complex nested object transformation maintains referential integrity

**API Serialization**

- transformMemoryToExport() produces properly typed export objects for API consumption
- API serialization removes internal metadata while preserving essential emotional intelligence data
- Input transformation validates and converts API inputs to internal Memory format
- Batch transformation maintains type safety across large datasets

**Migration and Versioning**

- Schema version migration maintains backward compatibility with older Memory formats
- Migration functions properly handle field additions without breaking existing data
- Version transformation validates schema compatibility and provides upgrade paths
- Migration utilities maintain type safety across version boundaries

### Integration Tests

**Cross-Package Type Safety**

- Memory operations from `@studio/memory` properly utilize schema types with full validation
- Validation package operations maintain type consistency with ValidationWorkflow types
- MCP package queries utilize proper types for mood context and timeline construction
- Database package operations align with schema interfaces for type-safe database access

**Validation Pipeline Integration**

- Schema validation integrates properly with validation middleware for processing pipelines
- Error handling maintains type safety with proper ValidationError type usage
- Batch validation operations handle large datasets with proper type preservation
- Async validation functions maintain type safety with Promise-based validation workflows

### Performance Tests

**Type System Performance**

- Type validation performance remains acceptable with complex nested emotional intelligence objects
- Zod schema validation maintains sub-millisecond performance for individual Memory objects
- Batch validation scales properly with 1000+ memory objects without performance degradation
- Type guard functions maintain consistent performance across different object sizes and complexity

**Memory Usage Validation**

- Type definitions don't cause excessive memory usage during TypeScript compilation
- Runtime validation maintains reasonable memory footprint with complex emotional intelligence data
- Schema caching properly reduces validation overhead for repeated operations
- Transformation utilities manage memory efficiently with large batch operations

## Mocking Requirements

**Type-Safe Test Data Factory**

- Memory factory generating valid Memory objects with realistic emotional context
- EmotionalContext factory with proper mood classification and theme distribution
- RelationshipDynamics factory with realistic measurement scales and participant data
- Validation factory creating proper ValidationWorkflow objects with workflow state progression

**Schema Validation Mocking**

- Mock invalid data structures for comprehensive validation error testing
- Generate boundary condition test cases for constraint validation (min/max values)
- Create complex nested object hierarchies for deep validation testing
- Mock async validation scenarios for external data requirement testing

**Performance Test Data**

- Large dataset generation for batch validation performance testing
- Complex nested object structures for type guard performance benchmarking
- Varied data complexity for transformation performance validation
- Memory-intensive datasets for validation memory usage testing
