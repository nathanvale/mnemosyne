# Technical Specification

This is the technical specification for the spec detailed in @.agent-os/specs/2025-08-08-advanced-typescript-interfaces/spec.md

> Created: 2025-08-08
> Version: 1.0.0

## Technical Requirements

**TypeScript Type System Architecture**:

- Comprehensive interface definitions across 8 primary modules in `packages/schema/src/`
- Core memory types (Memory, EmotionalContext, RelationshipDynamics) with nested object support
- Advanced validation types with workflow state management and quality assessment
- Processing metadata and temporal analysis types for complex emotional intelligence operations

**Zod Schema Integration**:

- Runtime validation schemas maintaining strict alignment with TypeScript interfaces
- Schema validation functions providing detailed error reporting with field-level validation messages
- Input/Output type variants enabling API serialization with proper transformation validation
- Batch validation capabilities for large-scale processing with performance optimization

**Type Safety and Validation**:

- Type guard functions providing runtime type checking with proper TypeScript type narrowing
- Schema validation utilities with configurable validation rules and custom constraint checking
- Advanced validation middleware supporting async validation with external data requirements
- Comprehensive error handling with validation severity levels (error, warning, info)

**Data Transformation System**:

- Database storage transformation maintaining type safety across Prisma client integration
- API serialization utilities with proper input validation and output formatting
- Export transformation functions supporting multiple output formats (JSON, CSV, analysis formats)
- Memory migration utilities for schema version evolution with backward compatibility

## Approach Options

**Type System Architecture** (Selected)

- **Modular interface organization with dedicated files for each domain**
- Pros: Clear separation of concerns, maintainable code organization, easy to extend
- Cons: Multiple import statements required, potential circular dependency management
- **Rationale**: Complex emotional intelligence domain requires clear modular organization for maintainability

**Alternative: Monolithic type definitions**

- Pros: Single import, no circular dependency concerns
- Cons: Massive single file, difficult to maintain, poor developer experience
- **Decision**: Modular approach chosen for maintainability and developer experience

**Validation Strategy** (Selected)

- **Zod schemas with TypeScript interface alignment**
- Pros: Runtime and compile-time validation, excellent TypeScript integration, performance optimized
- Cons: Dual maintenance of types and schemas, potential drift between interface and schema
- **Rationale**: Emotional intelligence data requires robust runtime validation for data integrity

**Alternative: Pure TypeScript with runtime validation**

- Pros: Single source of truth, no schema drift
- Cons: Manual runtime validation, error-prone validation logic, poor error reporting
- **Decision**: Zod chosen for robust validation with excellent TypeScript integration

## External Dependencies

**Zod** - Runtime schema validation library

- **Purpose**: Runtime type validation, schema definition, transformation utilities
- **Version**: ^3.25.74
- **Justification**: Provides robust runtime validation with excellent TypeScript integration for complex emotional intelligence data

**UUID library (v4)** - UUID generation utilities

- **Purpose**: Generating unique identifiers for Memory and related entities
- **Justification**: CUID format provides better performance and readability than standard UUIDs

**Date-fns** (conditional) - Date manipulation utilities

- **Purpose**: ISO 8601 date validation and temporal pattern analysis
- **Justification**: Temporal analysis requires robust date handling for emotional progression tracking
