# Technical Specification

This is the technical specification for the spec detailed in @.agent-os/specs/2025-08-08-prisma-database-schema/spec.md

> Created: 2025-08-08
> Version: 1.0.0

## Technical Requirements

**Prisma Schema Architecture**:

- Comprehensive schema.prisma file with 20+ models for data storage
- SQLite datasource configuration with file-based storage using DATABASE_URL
- Custom client output to packages/db/generated for monorepo structure
- Migration support with prisma migrate for schema evolution tracking

**Core Data Models**:

- Message table with unique hash constraint for content deduplication
- Link and Asset tables with foreign key relationships to Message
- Timestamp fields with DateTime types for temporal tracking
- Auto-increment primary keys for efficient record identification

**Memory Processing Schema**:

- Memory model with 15+ fields including clustering metadata
- JSON field storage for complex data structures (participants, themes)
- Confidence scoring system with 1-10 scale integer values
- Content hash with SHA-256 for memory deduplication

**Emotional Intelligence Models**:

- EmotionalContext with mood classification and intensity scoring
- RelationshipDynamics for participant interaction analysis
- MoodScore and MoodDelta for temporal emotional tracking
- JSON storage for complex nested data structures

**Performance Optimization**:

- Strategic indexes on frequently queried fields (extractedAt, confidence)
- Composite indexes for multi-field queries (extractedAt + confidence)
- Unique constraints on hash fields for deduplication enforcement
- Foreign key indexes for efficient relationship queries

## Approach Options

**ORM Selection** (Selected)

- **Prisma with SQLite database**
- Pros: Type safety, migration management, excellent DX, schema-first
- Cons: Learning curve, abstraction overhead, limited to SQL databases
- **Rationale**: Modern ORM with best-in-class TypeScript integration

**Alternative: TypeORM**

- Pros: Decorator-based, supports NoSQL, active record pattern
- Cons: Less type safety, complex configuration, heavier runtime
- **Decision**: Prisma provides superior developer experience

**Alternative: Raw SQL with query builder**

- Pros: Full control, minimal abstraction, maximum performance
- Cons: Manual type safety, no migration management, more code
- **Decision**: Prisma abstracts complexity while maintaining performance

**Database Selection** (Selected)

- **SQLite for development and production**
- Pros: Zero configuration, file-based, excellent for single-server
- Cons: Limited concurrent writes, no native JSON types
- **Rationale**: Perfect for application's scale and deployment model

**Schema Design** (Selected)

- **Normalized relational schema with JSON fields for complex data**
- Pros: Data integrity, efficient storage, flexible complex data
- Cons: More tables, join complexity, JSON parsing overhead
- **Rationale**: Balances normalization with practical flexibility

## External Dependencies

**@prisma/client** (6.11.1) - Prisma Client for database access

- **Purpose**: Type-safe database client with query builder
- **Justification**: Auto-generated from schema for perfect type safety

**prisma** (6.11.1) - Prisma CLI and migration tools

- **Purpose**: Schema management, migrations, and development tools
- **Justification**: Essential for database development workflow

**SQLite** - Embedded database engine

- **Purpose**: Lightweight, serverless database storage
- **Justification**: Perfect for application scale with zero configuration

## Database Schema Details

**Table Count**: 20+ tables including:

- Core tables: Message, Link, Asset
- Memory tables: Memory, EmotionalContext, RelationshipDynamics
- Analysis tables: MoodScore, MoodDelta, DeltaPattern, TurningPoint
- Clustering tables: MemoryCluster, ClusterMembership
- Quality tables: ValidationStatus, ValidationResult, QualityMetrics
- Metadata tables: AnalysisMetadata

**Field Statistics**:

- Memory table: 20+ fields including clustering metadata
- Total schema fields: 200+ across all tables
- JSON fields: 30+ for complex nested structures
- Index definitions: 15+ for query optimization

**Relationship Types**:

- One-to-many: Message to Links/Assets
- One-to-one: Memory to EmotionalContext/RelationshipDynamics
- Many-to-many: Memory to Message through junction table
- Self-referential: Cluster hierarchies and memory relationships
