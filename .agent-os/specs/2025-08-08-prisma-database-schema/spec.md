# Prisma Database Schema Spec

> Spec: Prisma Database Schema with SQLite
> Created: 2025-08-08
> Status: Completed Implementation

## Overview

Implement comprehensive database schema using Prisma ORM with SQLite, featuring Message, Link, and Asset tables for core functionality, plus extensive emotional intelligence and memory processing tables. This schema provides content deduplication, relationship tracking, mood analysis, and sophisticated clustering capabilities for emotional context understanding.

## User Stories

### Database Schema Management

As a **backend developer**, I want a well-structured database schema so that I can efficiently store and query messages, memories, and emotional intelligence data with proper relationships and optimized indexes for high-performance operations.

The schema provides:

- Prisma schema definition with 3 core tables and extensive emotional intelligence models
- SQLite database with file-based storage for development and production
- Content hash-based deduplication preventing duplicate message storage
- Comprehensive indexing strategy for optimized query performance

### Memory and Emotional Processing

As a **data scientist**, I want sophisticated memory and emotional context storage so that I can analyze conversation patterns, track mood changes, and understand relationship dynamics through structured data models and relationships.

The system supports:

- Memory extraction with confidence scoring and participant tracking
- Emotional context analysis with mood, intensity, and theme storage
- Relationship dynamics tracking across participants and conversations
- Clustering capabilities for pattern recognition and memory grouping

### Data Quality and Validation

As a **data quality engineer**, I want comprehensive validation and quality tracking so that I can ensure data integrity, track processing status, and maintain high-quality datasets through validation rules and quality metrics.

The system enables:

- Validation status tracking with error reporting and resolution workflow
- Quality metrics with numerical scores and dimensional assessments
- Deduplication metadata for tracking merge history and conflicts
- Analysis metadata for processing status and configuration tracking

## Spec Scope

### In Scope

**Core Data Models**:

- Message table with timestamp, sender, content, and unique hash
- Link table for URL extraction from messages with foreign key relationships
- Asset table for file attachments with type and filename tracking
- Generated Prisma client with custom output directory configuration

**Emotional Intelligence Schema**:

- Memory table with 54+ fields for comprehensive memory storage
- EmotionalContext with mood, intensity, themes, and markers
- RelationshipDynamics for participant interaction tracking
- MoodScore and MoodDelta for temporal mood analysis

**Clustering and Analysis Models**:

- MemoryCluster for grouping related memories with themes
- ClusterMembership for many-to-many cluster relationships
- DeltaPattern for identifying mood change patterns
- TurningPoint for significant emotional moment detection

**Data Quality Infrastructure**:

- ValidationStatus for tracking data validation state
- ValidationResult for detailed validation outcomes
- QualityMetrics for multi-dimensional quality assessment
- AnalysisMetadata for processing configuration tracking

**Database Configuration**:

- Prisma client generation to packages/db/generated directory
- SQLite datasource with DATABASE_URL environment variable
- Migration support with Prisma Migrate for schema evolution
- Database introspection and studio for development

### Out of Scope

**Advanced Database Features**:

- Multi-database support beyond SQLite
- Database replication or sharding strategies
- Custom database functions or stored procedures
- Advanced transaction management beyond Prisma defaults

**External Integrations**:

- Third-party database providers or cloud databases
- Real-time database synchronization or streaming
- Database backup and restore automation
- Cross-database migration tools

**Performance Optimization**:

- Database query optimization beyond index creation
- Custom caching layers or query result caching
- Database connection pooling configuration
- Advanced performance monitoring or profiling

## Expected Deliverable

1. **Comprehensive database schema** - Verify Prisma schema defines all required tables with proper relationships and constraints
2. **Generated Prisma client** - Ensure client generates to custom output directory with full type safety
3. **Migration management** - Validate schema changes tracked through Prisma migrations with version control
4. **Development tooling** - Confirm database studio and introspection tools enable efficient development
