> Spec: Fix Flaky Calibration Test
> Created: 2025-08-09
> Status: Planning

## Overview

Fix the flaky test "should simulate parameter adjustment with high success rate" in the mood-scoring calibration system that intermittently fails due to randomness in the simulation. The test expects a 70% success rate but sometimes gets 65% due to the inherent randomness of Math.random().

## User Stories

### Test Reliability Story

As a developer, I want the calibration system tests to be deterministic and reliable, so that CI/CD pipelines don't fail due to random variations in test execution.

When running the test suite, the calibration system tests should consistently pass without relying on probabilistic outcomes. The test currently uses Math.random() to simulate a 90% success rate over 20 iterations, expecting at least 70% success (14/20), but due to randomness, it sometimes only achieves 65% (13/20), causing intermittent failures.

### Maintainability Story

As a maintainer, I want to preserve the simulation behavior in production code while making tests deterministic, so that the production code remains unchanged and tests accurately validate the expected behavior.

The solution should allow tests to override the random behavior with deterministic values while keeping the production implementation intact. This ensures that the actual calibration system continues to use randomness as designed, but tests can validate specific scenarios reliably.

## Spec Scope

1. **Deterministic Test Mode** - Add capability for tests to provide deterministic behavior instead of random values
2. **Test Helper Functions** - Create test utilities for controlled simulation of success/failure patterns
3. **Fix Flaky Test** - Update the failing test to use deterministic simulation ensuring consistent pass rate
4. **Preserve Production Behavior** - Maintain existing random behavior in production code
5. **Test Coverage Validation** - Ensure all calibration tests continue to pass with the changes

## Out of Scope

- Changing the production randomness algorithm
- Modifying the 90% success rate simulation in production
- Refactoring the entire calibration system
- Adding new features to the calibration system
- Changing test thresholds or expectations

## Expected Deliverable

1. All calibration system tests pass consistently without random failures
2. The "should simulate parameter adjustment with high success rate" test reliably achieves the expected 70% threshold
3. Production code maintains its original random simulation behavior
