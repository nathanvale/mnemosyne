# Sophisticated Database Schema Spec

> Spec: Sophisticated Database Schema for Emotional Intelligence
> Created: 2025-08-08
> Status: Completed Implementation

## Overview

Document and validate the comprehensive 54-table database architecture that transforms abstract emotional concepts into queryable, relational data structures. This sophisticated schema enables complex emotional intelligence processing through memory storage, mood analysis, clustering systems, and validation workflows with optimized performance for large-scale emotional data processing.

## User Stories

### Emotional Memory Storage and Retrieval

As a **memory processing system**, I want sophisticated database tables for emotional intelligence so that I can store, query, and analyze complex psychological data with relational integrity and performance optimization.

The system provides:

- Core Memory table with emotional context and relationship dynamics foreign keys
- Complex indexes optimized for temporal analysis, confidence filtering, and clustering queries
- Deduplication system with SHA-256 content hashing and merge history metadata
- Cascading deletes maintaining referential integrity across 54 interconnected tables

### Multi-Dimensional Mood Analysis Storage

As a **mood scoring system**, I want specialized database tables for mood analysis so that I can store mood scores, factors, deltas, and pattern analysis with full temporal and relational context.

The system supports:

- MoodScore table with confidence levels, descriptors, and algorithm version tracking
- MoodFactor table with weighted evidence and internal factor scoring for analysis
- MoodDelta table with magnitude, direction, and significance scoring for temporal analysis
- Optimized indexes for score range queries, confidence filtering, and temporal correlation analysis

### Tone-Tagged Memory Clustering Storage

As a **clustering system**, I want database tables for psychological organization so that I can store memory clusters, membership relationships, and pattern analyses with coherence validation and quality metrics.

The system enables:

- MemoryCluster table with coherence scores, psychological significance, and participant patterns
- ClusterMembership table with membership strength and contribution scoring
- PatternAnalysis table with pattern types, frequencies, and psychological indicators
- Quality validation with coherence thresholds and meaningfulness assessment

### Emotional Timeline and Pattern Storage

As a **temporal analysis system**, I want database tables for emotional progression so that I can store delta patterns, turning points, and validation results with temporal context and significance scoring.

The system delivers:

- DeltaPattern table with pattern types (recovery, decline, plateau, oscillation) and significance
- TurningPoint table with breakthrough/setback analysis and temporal context
- ValidationResult table with human-algorithm agreement tracking and bias indicators
- Complex association tables managing pattern-delta relationships with sequence ordering

## Spec Scope

### In Scope

**Core Memory Architecture**:

- Primary Memory table with emotional context, relationship dynamics, and validation status relationships
- Message, Link, and Asset tables with foreign key relationships to Memory for content storage
- Deduplication system with content hashing, clustering metadata, and participation tracking
- Complex indexing strategy optimized for temporal analysis, confidence filtering, and clustering queries

**Emotional Intelligence Tables**:

- EmotionalContext table with mood classification, intensity, themes, markers, and temporal patterns
- RelationshipDynamics table with overall dynamics, participant dynamics, and interaction quality
- ValidationStatus table with workflow states, refinement suggestions, and approval history
- QualityMetrics table with dimensional quality, confidence alignment, and evidence support

**Mood Analysis Framework**:

- MoodScore table with 0-10 scoring, confidence levels, descriptors, and algorithm version tracking
- MoodFactor table with type classification, weight distribution, evidence arrays, and internal scoring
- MoodDelta table with magnitude, direction, significance, and temporal context for transition analysis
- AnalysisMetadata table with processing duration, confidence, quality metrics, and issue tracking

**Clustering and Pattern System**:

- MemoryCluster table with coherence scores, psychological significance, and participant pattern analysis
- ClusterMembership table with membership strength, contribution scoring, and temporal tracking
- PatternAnalysis table with pattern types, frequency analysis, and psychological indicator tracking
- ClusterQualityMetrics table with coherence assessment, meaningfulness scoring, and improvement areas

**Temporal Pattern Analysis**:

- DeltaPattern table with pattern type classification, significance scoring, and duration tracking
- DeltaPatternAssociation table managing pattern-delta relationships with sequence ordering
- TurningPoint table with type classification, magnitude analysis, and temporal context
- ValidationResult table with human-algorithm agreement, discrepancy analysis, and validator tracking

**Performance Optimization**:

- Comprehensive indexing strategy across all tables for optimal query performance
- Composite indexes for complex queries combining temporal, confidence, and significance factors
- Cascade delete relationships maintaining referential integrity without orphaned records
- Memory-specific indexes for mood analysis, clustering queries, and validation workflows

### Out of Scope

**Advanced Database Features**:

- Database sharding or horizontal scaling beyond single SQLite instance
- Complex stored procedures or database-level business logic beyond triggers
- Real-time database synchronization or streaming replication systems
- Advanced caching layers or database performance monitoring beyond basic indexing

**Production Database Management**:

- Database backup and recovery systems beyond basic SQLite file management
- Advanced security features like row-level security or encryption at rest
- Database migration strategies for production deployments with zero downtime
- Advanced analytics or reporting views beyond core operational tables

## Expected Deliverable

1. **54-table validation** - Verify comprehensive database schema supports all emotional intelligence components with proper relationships
2. **Performance optimization confirmation** - Ensure optimized indexing strategies provide sub-2-second query response for complex emotional intelligence queries
3. **Referential integrity validation** - Confirm cascade relationships and foreign key constraints maintain data consistency
4. **Storage efficiency verification** - Validate deduplication system and content hashing prevent storage bloat while maintaining data quality
