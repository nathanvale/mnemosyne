## Test Coverage

### Database Schema Validation Tests

**Schema Integrity Tests**

- Verify all 54 tables are created with correct field types and constraints
- Validate foreign key relationships maintain referential integrity across phases
- Test cascade delete operations preserve data consistency
- Ensure unique constraints prevent duplicate content hash storage

**Index Performance Tests**

- Memory table temporal queries complete within 100ms for 1000+ records
- MoodScore composite index queries (score+confidence) optimize filtering performance
- MoodDelta significance-based queries utilize proper indexes for pattern analysis
- Clustering queries with membership strength filtering perform within 200ms

### Data Relationship Tests

**Core Memory Relationships**

- Memory creation establishes proper foreign key relationships to EmotionalContext and RelationshipDynamics
- ValidationStatus workflow state changes maintain consistency with Memory confidence scores
- QualityMetrics calculations align with Memory processing metadata and confidence levels
- AnalysisMetadata processing duration tracking correlates with actual processing times

**Mood Analysis Integration**

- MoodScore creation with MoodFactor evidence maintains weighted scoring consistency
- MoodDelta magnitude calculations align with score transitions and significance assessment
- DeltaPattern sequence ordering maintains temporal consistency in pattern associations
- TurningPoint significance scoring correlates with delta magnitude and pattern analysis

**Clustering System Integration**

- MemoryCluster coherence scores reflect actual psychological meaningfulness of grouped memories
- ClusterMembership strength calculations maintain consistency with contribution scoring
- PatternAnalysis frequency tracking aligns with actual cluster member analysis
- ClusterQualityMetrics assessment provides actionable improvement recommendations

### Performance and Scale Tests

**Query Performance Benchmarks**

- Complex emotional intelligence queries (joining 5+ tables) complete within 2 seconds
- Temporal analysis queries across large datasets utilize proper indexing strategies
- Clustering queries with coherence and significance filtering perform within acceptable limits
- Validation result queries with agreement analysis maintain sub-second response times

**Data Volume Testing**

- Schema handles 10,000+ memories with proper performance characteristics
- Mood analysis tables scale to 50,000+ mood scores with optimized query performance
- Clustering system maintains coherence with 1,000+ clusters and 50,000+ memberships
- Pattern analysis maintains accuracy with complex delta pattern sequences

### Integration Tests

**Cross-Package Integration**

- Memory operations from `@studio/memory` properly utilize schema constraints and relationships
- Validation package operations maintain consistency with ValidationStatus and QualityMetrics
- MCP package queries utilize proper indexes for mood context and timeline construction
- Schema package type validation aligns with database constraints and field definitions

**Data Consistency Tests**

- Deduplication system prevents content hash collisions while preserving merge metadata
- Clustering participation counts remain consistent with actual cluster membership records
- Validation workflow states align with processing confidence and quality metric assessments
- Temporal pattern analysis maintains consistency across mood deltas and turning points

## Mocking Requirements

**Database Test Isolation**

- Each test gets isolated database instance using worker-specific database paths
- Test database creation uses `db push` for faster schema application than migrations
- Database cleanup ensures no test data persists between test runs

**Complex Data Factory**

- Memory factory with realistic emotional context and relationship dynamics
- MoodScore factory with proper factor weighting and evidence arrays
- Cluster factory with coherent theme organization and quality metrics
- Pattern factory with realistic delta sequences and turning point analysis

**Performance Test Mocking**

- Large dataset generation for performance benchmarking without external dependencies
- Realistic emotional intelligence data patterns for clustering and mood analysis testing
- Temporal data sequences for delta pattern and timeline construction validation
