# Technical Specification

This is the technical specification for the spec detailed in @.agent-os/specs/2025-08-08-sophisticated-database-schema/spec.md

> Created: 2025-08-08
> Version: 1.0.0

## Technical Requirements

**Database Architecture**:

- SQLite database with 54 tables for comprehensive emotional intelligence storage
- Prisma ORM with generated client in `packages/db/generated/` for type-safe database access
- Complex foreign key relationships with cascade delete operations maintaining referential integrity
- SHA-256 content hashing system preventing duplicate memory storage with merge history tracking

**Performance Optimization**:

- Comprehensive indexing strategy with single-column and composite indexes for optimal query performance
- Memory table indexes: extractedAt, confidence, extractedAt+confidence, createdAt, lastClusteredAt+clusterParticipationCount
- MoodScore indexes: memoryId, calculatedAt, score, confidence, score+confidence for multi-dimensional queries
- MoodDelta indexes: significance, conversationId+deltaSequence, direction, type, magnitude for pattern analysis

**Schema Organization**:

- Phase 1: Core message storage (Message, Link, Asset tables)
- Phase 2: Memory and emotional intelligence (Memory, EmotionalContext, RelationshipDynamics, ValidationStatus)
- Phase 3: Mood scoring and analysis (MoodScore, MoodFactor, MoodDelta, AnalysisMetadata)
- Phase 4: Clustering and patterns (MemoryCluster, ClusterMembership, PatternAnalysis, ClusterQualityMetrics)

## Approach Options

**Database Selection** (Selected)

- **SQLite for development and single-user scenarios**
- Pros: Zero-configuration, file-based, excellent development experience, supports complex relationships
- Cons: Single-writer limitation, not suitable for multi-user production without scaling strategy
- **Rationale**: Optimal for Phase 2 emotional intelligence development and testing before production scaling

**Alternative: PostgreSQL for production**

- Pros: Multi-user support, advanced indexing, better concurrency, production-ready
- Cons: Additional infrastructure complexity, configuration requirements
- **Decision**: SQLite chosen for current phase with PostgreSQL migration planned for Phase 8

**ORM Strategy** (Selected)

- **Prisma ORM with generated client**
- Pros: Type-safe database operations, excellent TypeScript integration, migration management
- Cons: Additional abstraction layer, potential performance overhead for complex queries
- **Rationale**: Type safety and developer experience critical for complex emotional intelligence queries

## External Dependencies

**Prisma ORM** - Database toolkit and ORM

- **Purpose**: Type-safe database operations, schema management, migration system
- **Justification**: Complex emotional intelligence schema requires type safety and relationship management

**uuid library** - UUID generation for unique identifiers

- **Purpose**: Generating unique IDs for Memory, EmotionalContext, and other primary keys
- **Justification**: CUID format provides better database performance than standard UUIDs

**sqlite3** - SQLite database engine

- **Purpose**: Embedded database for development and single-user scenarios
- **Justification**: Zero-configuration database perfect for emotional intelligence development phase
