# Memory Processing Engine Spec

> Spec: Memory Processing Engine  
> Created: 2025-08-08  
> Status: Completed Implementation

## Overview

Implement comprehensive AI-powered system that transforms structured message history into meaningful emotional memories through intelligent Claude integration. This core engine extracts emotional intelligence from conversational data using sophisticated batch processing, optimized prompting, and robust error recovery while maintaining cost efficiency and quality standards.

## User Stories

### Claude-Powered Memory Extraction

As a **memory extraction system**, I want sophisticated Claude integration capabilities so that I can analyze conversational content and extract meaningful emotional context, relationship dynamics, and personal significance from raw message data.

The system provides:

- Claude Pro API integration with comprehensive authentication, rate limiting, and cost management
- Structured prompt engineering for emotional context extraction and relationship dynamics assessment
- Response parsing and memory formatting with confidence scoring and evidence extraction
- Cost-efficient processing staying within Claude Pro account limits through intelligent batch management

### Intelligent Batch Processing

As a **memory processing system**, I want intelligent batch processing capabilities so that I can efficiently handle large message collections while optimizing for quality, speed, and cost considerations.

The system supports:

- Intelligent message batch creation based on conversation context and temporal relevance
- Queue management for processing large message collections with progress tracking and completion reporting
- Batch optimization balancing quality extraction with API cost efficiency (500-1000 messages within limits)
- Comprehensive error recovery with retry logic and failure handling for production reliability

### Quality Memory Generation

As a **memory validation system**, I want high-quality memory generation capabilities so that I can receive structured emotional memories with confidence scoring and evidence support ready for human validation.

The system enables:

- Emotional context analysis including mood classification, intensity scoring, and thematic identification
- Relationship dynamics assessment with closeness, tension, and supportiveness measurement
- Participant identification and role analysis with communication pattern recognition
- Quality assurance framework with confidence scoring (8+ average) and validation readiness
