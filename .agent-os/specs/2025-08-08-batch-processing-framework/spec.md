> Spec: Batch Processing Framework with Advanced Memory Management
> Created: 2025-08-08
> Status: Completed Implementation

## Overview

Implement sophisticated batch processing framework that handles large-scale memory dataset operations with configurable batch sizes, error handling, progress tracking, and resource optimization. This system provides reliable large dataset processing capabilities through memory-efficient batching, comprehensive validation, transaction management, and performance monitoring for scalable data processing operations.

## User Stories

### Configurable Batch Processing Engine

As a **data processing system**, I want configurable batch processing capabilities so that I can handle large datasets efficiently with appropriate resource management and optimal processing performance for various data volumes.

The system provides:

- Configurable batch sizing with dynamic adjustment based on memory usage and processing performance
- Batch boundary management with transaction isolation and data integrity preservation across processing operations
- Progress tracking with detailed batch-level statistics and processing rate measurement for monitoring
- Resource utilization monitoring with memory and CPU usage tracking for optimal system performance

### Advanced Error Handling and Recovery

As a **data reliability system**, I want sophisticated error handling capabilities so that I can continue processing despite individual failures while maintaining data integrity and comprehensive error reporting.

The system supports:

- Continue-on-error processing with configurable failure tolerance and batch-level error isolation
- Error categorization with validation errors, database errors, and deduplication conflicts for targeted resolution
- Comprehensive error reporting with detailed error context, stack traces, and recovery recommendations
- Batch-level rollback capabilities with transaction management and data consistency preservation

### Memory Processing with Deduplication

As a **memory management system**, I want integrated deduplication processing so that I can eliminate duplicate memories while processing large datasets efficiently with comprehensive duplicate detection and merge strategies.

The system enables:

- Memory deduplication integration with content hashing and similarity analysis for duplicate elimination
- Batch-level duplicate tracking with session-based hash management and cross-batch consistency
- Similar memory merging with confidence scoring and metadata preservation for intelligent consolidation
- Deduplication statistics with duplicate rates, merge success rates, and processing efficiency metrics

### Schema Validation and Data Quality

As a **data quality system**, I want comprehensive validation capabilities so that I can ensure data integrity before processing with detailed validation reporting and schema compliance verification.

The system delivers:

- Schema validation with comprehensive field validation and type checking for data integrity
- Configurable validation timing with pre-processing validation or inline validation during processing
- Validation error reporting with detailed field-level errors and corrective action recommendations
- Data transformation support with legacy data conversion and schema migration capabilities
