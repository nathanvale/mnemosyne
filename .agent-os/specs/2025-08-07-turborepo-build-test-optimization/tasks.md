## Tasks

- [ ] 1. Configure Turborepo Pipeline for test:build
  - [ ] 1.1 Write tests for turbo.json configuration validation
  - [ ] 1.2 Add test:build task definition to turbo.json
  - [ ] 1.3 Configure proper dependencies (test:build depends on build)
  - [ ] 1.4 Set appropriate inputs and outputs for caching
  - [ ] 1.5 Add required environment variables
  - [ ] 1.6 Verify task runs correctly with turbo test:build

- [ ] 2. Optimize Build Test Scripts

  - [ ] 2.2 Remove redundant pnpm build from test-build.sh
  - [ ] 2.3 Update script to verify dist exists (built by Turborepo)
  - [ ] 2.4 Ensure proper error handling if dist is missing
  - [ ] 2.5 Test script works with Turborepo dependency chain
  - [ ] 2.6 Verify all build tests still pass

- [ ] 3. Clean Up Test Files and Scripts
  - [ ] 3.1 Audit all test files for duplicates and unused code
  - [ ] 3.2 Remove redundant test scripts from scripts/ directory
  - [ ] 3.3 Clean up any generated .d.ts files in test directories
  - [ ] 3.4 Consolidate duplicate test utilities if found
  - [ ] 3.5 Update .gitignore to prevent committing generated test files
  - [ ] 3.6 Verify all tests still pass after cleanup

- [ ] 4. Code Quality Review and Fixes
  - [ ] 4.1 Run full ESLint check and fix any issues
  - [ ] 4.2 Run Prettier format check and fix formatting
  - [ ] 4.3 Review all TypeScript files for consistent patterns
  - [ ] 4.4 Check for unused dependencies in package.json
  - [ ] 4.5 Verify all exports are properly typed
  - [ ] 4.6 Ensure error handling is consistent across all hooks

  - [ ] 5.1 Review package.json for monorepo best practices
  - [ ] 5.2 Verify tsconfig.json follows monorepo standards
  - [ ] 5.3 Check ESLint config properly extends shared config
  - [ ] 5.4 Validate all bin paths point to correct dist locations
  - [ ] 5.5 Ensure package exports are correctly configured
  - [ ] 5.6 Run final build to verify everything compiles

- [ ] 6. Final Validation and Testing
  - [ ] 6.1 Run pnpm test to verify unit tests pass
  - [ ] 6.2 Run turbo test:build to verify build tests pass with caching
  - [ ] 6.3 Test cache invalidation by modifying source files
  - [ ] 6.4 Verify parallel execution with turbo test test:build
  - [ ] 6.5 Run pnpm check to ensure all quality checks pass
  - [ ] 6.6 Create PR-ready summary of all changes
