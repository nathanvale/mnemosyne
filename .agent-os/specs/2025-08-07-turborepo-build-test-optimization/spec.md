> Spec: Turborepo Build Test Optimization and Package Cleanup
> Created: 2025-08-07
> Status: Planning

## Overview

Optimize the claude-hooks package by integrating build tests into the Turborepo pipeline, performing comprehensive code cleanup, and preparing the package for production release. This will improve build performance, maintain test separation, and ensure the package meets quality standards for PR submission.

## User Stories

### Developer Experience Enhancement

As a developer working on the claude-hooks package, I want build tests to be properly integrated with Turborepo, so that I can benefit from intelligent caching and avoid redundant builds while maintaining clear separation between unit and integration tests.

The workflow involves running tests efficiently with proper caching, where unit tests run on source code and build tests validate the compiled output, all orchestrated through Turborepo's pipeline system.

### Package Maintainer Quality Assurance

As a package maintainer, I want the claude-hooks package to be thoroughly reviewed and cleaned up, so that it meets production quality standards and can be confidently submitted for PR review.

This includes removing redundant code, fixing any linting issues, ensuring consistent patterns, and verifying all tests pass reliably.

## Spec Scope

1. **Turborepo Pipeline Integration** - Configure test:build task in turbo.json with proper dependencies and caching
2. **Build Script Optimization** - Remove redundant build steps from test-build.sh to leverage Turborepo's dependency management
3. **Test File Organization** - Clean up and organize test files, removing any duplicates or unnecessary test utilities
4. **Code Quality Review** - Perform comprehensive review of all package code for consistency and best practices
5. **Package Configuration Cleanup** - Ensure package.json, tsconfig, and other configs follow monorepo standards

## Out of Scope

- Modifying the core functionality of the hooks
- Changing the existing test coverage requirements
- Altering the package's public API
- Migrating to different testing frameworks

## Expected Deliverable

1. Fully integrated test:build task working within Turborepo pipeline with proper caching
2. Clean, organized test suite with no redundant files or scripts
3. Package ready for PR submission with all quality checks passing
