> Spec: Code Review Medium Priority Improvements
> Created: 2025-08-14
> Status: Planning

## Overview

Implement medium priority improvements for the @studio/code-review package focusing on consistency, documentation, performance, and maintainability. These improvements build upon the critical fixes to create a more robust and user-friendly package.

## User Stories

### Consistent Developer Experience Story

As a developer working with the code-review package, I want consistent error handling patterns and naming conventions across all CLI tools, so that I can predictably handle errors and understand the available commands.

The developer encounters consistent error formats whether using analyze-pr, fetch-coderabbit, or any other CLI command. All commands follow a predictable naming pattern and provide uniform error responses that can be programmatically handled or easily understood in terminal output.

### Self-Service Documentation Story

As a new user of the code-review package, I want comprehensive documentation with troubleshooting guides and examples, so that I can quickly integrate the tool into my CI/CD pipeline without needing external support.

The user finds clear documentation explaining the relationship between different CLI commands, common setup issues with solutions, and real-world examples of integrating with GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, and other popular CI/CD platforms.

### Performance Optimization Story

As a user analyzing large PRs, I want the tool to handle external API calls and file operations efficiently, so that analysis completes in reasonable time without blocking other operations.

The user can analyze large PRs with hundreds of files, seeing progress indicators and receiving results within predictable timeframes. Network timeouts are handled gracefully, and file operations are optimized to minimize I/O blocking.

## Spec Scope

1. **Error Handling Standardization** - Implement consistent error patterns across all modules
2. **CLI Naming Convention** - Standardize all CLI script names to follow a predictable pattern
3. **Documentation Enhancement** - Create comprehensive docs with troubleshooting and examples
4. **Performance Optimization** - Add timeouts for API calls and optimize file operations
5. **Architecture Documentation** - Document the complex architecture and module boundaries

## Out of Scope

- Package splitting into multiple sub-packages (noted for future major refactor)
- Plugin architecture implementation (future extensibility feature)
- Rate limiting for external APIs (will be added in production hardening phase)
- Caching strategy for repeated analysis (performance optimization phase 2)
- Monitoring and alerting implementation (production deployment phase)

## Expected Deliverable

1. All modules using consistent error classes and handling patterns with standardized error codes
2. CLI commands renamed to follow `code-review:*` pattern with backwards compatibility aliases
3. Complete documentation including architecture diagrams, troubleshooting guide, and CI/CD examples
4. All external API calls with configurable timeouts and proper timeout error handling
5. File operations converted to async patterns with progress feedback for large operations
