# Spec Requirements Document

> Spec: CLAUDE.md Expert Maintenance Command
> Created: 2025-08-14
> Status: Planning

## Overview

Build an expert-level command called `claude-md-update` that maintains and optimizes CLAUDE.md files using Claude Code's own capabilities, following Anthropic's official recommendations and community best practices. This tool will enable developers and teams to maintain high-quality AI instruction files that maximize Claude Code's effectiveness through intelligent analysis, optimization, and continuous improvement.

## User Stories

### Solo Developer Story

As a solo developer, I want to automatically maintain and optimize my CLAUDE.md file, so that I can maximize Claude Code's performance without manually tracking best practices and codebase changes.

The tool analyzes my git history, identifies new patterns in my codebase, detects when my CLAUDE.md becomes outdated, and suggests specific improvements. It provides intelligent updates based on how my code has evolved, what new libraries I've added, and what patterns have emerged that Claude should know about.

### Team Lead Story

As a team lead, I want to synchronize individual developer preferences with team-wide CLAUDE.md standards, so that all team members get consistent AI assistance while preserving personal workflow preferences.

The tool manages both shared team standards and individual customizations, provides conflict resolution when team standards change, and ensures that all team members' CLAUDE.md files stay aligned with current project architecture and coding standards.

### DevOps Engineer Story

As a DevOps engineer, I want to optimize CLAUDE.md files for performance and integrate them into CI/CD workflows, so that AI assistance becomes a reliable part of our development infrastructure.

The tool provides token usage analytics, cache effectiveness monitoring, validation checks for CLAUDE.md syntax and structure, and integration hooks for automated workflows that ensure CLAUDE.md files never fall out of sync with the actual codebase.

## Spec Scope

1. **Intelligent Codebase Analysis** - Analyze git history, detect architectural changes, and identify new patterns that should be documented in CLAUDE.md.
2. **Claude-Powered Self-Optimization** - Use Claude Code's own analysis capabilities to review and improve CLAUDE.md content quality and structure.
3. **Performance Monitoring and Optimization** - Track token usage, monitor cache effectiveness, and optimize prompt caching directives for maximum performance.
4. **Team Collaboration Features** - Synchronize individual preferences with team standards, manage conflicts, and provide shared configuration management.
5. **Safety and Reliability Features** - Git-based backup system, rollback capabilities, validation checks, and integration with development workflows.

## Out of Scope

- Real-time editing or IDE integration (this is a CLI tool)
- Custom AI model training or fine-tuning
- Integration with non-Claude AI systems
- Project management or task tracking features
- Code generation or modification (only CLAUDE.md maintenance)

## Expected Deliverable

1. A CLI command `claude-md-update` that can analyze any codebase and provide specific, actionable recommendations for CLAUDE.md improvements.
2. Integration capability with existing development workflows including git hooks, CI/CD pipelines, and team collaboration tools.
3. Performance analytics dashboard showing token usage trends, cache hit rates, and optimization opportunities that developers can verify through Claude Code usage.
