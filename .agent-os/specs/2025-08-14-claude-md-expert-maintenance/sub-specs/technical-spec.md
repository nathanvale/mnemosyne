# Technical Specification

This is the technical specification for the spec detailed in @.agent-os/specs/2025-08-14-claude-md-expert-maintenance/spec.md

> Created: 2025-08-14
> Version: 1.0.0

## Technical Requirements

### Core Analysis Engine

- **Git History Analysis**: Parse git log, diff analysis, file change frequency tracking, and commit message pattern recognition
- **Codebase Pattern Detection**: Static code analysis, dependency analysis, architectural pattern identification, and code style detection
- **CLAUDE.md Content Analysis**: Parse existing CLAUDE.md structure, identify outdated sections, detect missing patterns, and validate syntax
- **Performance Metrics Collection**: Token usage tracking, response time monitoring, cache hit rate analysis, and effectiveness scoring

### Claude API Integration

- **Self-Analysis Capabilities**: Use Claude Code's analysis features to review and improve CLAUDE.md content quality
- **Content Generation**: Generate new sections, improve existing descriptions, and create context-aware recommendations
- **Validation and Testing**: Test generated content against actual codebase patterns and validate effectiveness

### Configuration Management

- **Individual Preferences**: Personal coding style preferences, project-specific customizations, and workflow integrations
- **Team Standards**: Shared team configurations, conflict resolution mechanisms, and synchronization protocols
- **Hierarchical Configuration**: Global defaults, team overrides, project-specific settings, and individual customizations

### Data Storage and Persistence

- **Local Configuration Storage**: JSON-based configuration files, cache management, and preference persistence
- **Git Integration**: Backup strategies, rollback mechanisms, and branch-aware updates
- **Performance Data**: Historical metrics, trend analysis, and optimization recommendations

## Approach Options

**Option A: Standalone CLI Tool with External API Calls**

- Pros: Simple architecture, easy distribution, minimal dependencies
- Cons: Requires API keys, network dependencies, potential rate limiting

**Option B: Local Analysis with Optional Claude Integration** (Selected)

- Pros: Works offline for basic analysis, optional enhanced features, no API key requirements for basic functionality
- Cons: More complex architecture, larger binary size

**Option C: VS Code Extension with CLI Backend**

- Pros: Integrated user experience, real-time feedback, editor integration
- Cons: Platform-specific, complex distribution, requires VS Code

**Rationale:** Option B provides the best balance of functionality and usability. It allows users to get immediate value from local analysis while optionally enhancing capabilities with Claude integration. This approach respects different team setups and doesn't create hard dependencies on external services.

## External Dependencies

### Core Dependencies

- **Git CLI Interface**: Required for repository analysis and history parsing
- **Justification**: Essential for analyzing codebase evolution and managing backups

- **Node.js/TypeScript Runtime**: Modern JavaScript runtime for cross-platform compatibility
- **Justification**: Provides excellent CLI tooling, JSON processing, and filesystem operations

- **Commander.js**: CLI framework for argument parsing and command structure
- **Justification**: Industry standard for Node.js CLI applications with excellent documentation

### Optional Dependencies

- **Claude API SDK**: For enhanced content analysis and generation
- **Justification**: Enables advanced self-optimization features while remaining optional

- **Inquirer.js**: Interactive command-line prompts for guided setup
- **Justification**: Improves user experience for initial configuration and complex operations

- **Chalk**: Terminal styling for improved output readability
- **Justification**: Enhances user experience with colored, formatted output

## Architecture Patterns

### Plugin Architecture

- Modular analysis engines for different codebase types
- Extensible rule system for CLAUDE.md optimization
- Custom formatter plugins for different output formats

### Event-Driven Updates

- File system watchers for automatic trigger detection
- Git hook integration for workflow automation
- Configuration change propagation system

### Caching Strategy

- Intelligent caching of analysis results to avoid redundant processing
- Versioned cache invalidation based on codebase changes
- Performance metrics caching for trend analysis

## Security and Safety Considerations

### Data Privacy

- Local-first approach with optional cloud features
- No sensitive code data transmitted to external services
- User consent required for any external API calls

### Git Safety

- Atomic operations with rollback capabilities
- Branch detection to avoid conflicts with active development
- Backup creation before any CLAUDE.md modifications

### Configuration Validation

- Schema validation for all configuration files
- Safe defaults for all optional settings
- Graceful degradation when features are unavailable
