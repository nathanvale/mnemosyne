## Test Coverage

### Unit Tests

**GitAnalyzer**

- Parse git log output with various formats and edge cases
- Handle repositories with no history or single commits
- Extract meaningful patterns from commit messages and file changes
- Detect architectural changes from file system modifications

**CodebaseAnalyzer**

- Identify programming languages and frameworks from file extensions and package files
- Detect architectural patterns from directory structure and import statements
- Parse package.json, requirements.txt, Cargo.toml and other dependency files
- Handle monorepos and multi-language projects correctly

**ClaudeMdParser**

- Parse existing CLAUDE.md files with various structures and formats
- Validate syntax and identify structural issues
- Extract sections, import statements, and cache directives correctly
- Handle malformed or incomplete CLAUDE.md files gracefully

**ConfigurationManager**

- Merge hierarchical configurations correctly (global → team → project → individual)
- Resolve conflicts between different configuration levels
- Validate configuration schemas and provide helpful error messages
- Handle missing or corrupted configuration files

**PerformanceTracker**

- Collect and store token usage metrics accurately
- Calculate cache hit rates and effectiveness scores
- Generate trend analysis and optimization recommendations
- Handle data persistence and cleanup of old metrics

### Integration Tests

**End-to-End Command Execution**

- Run full analysis on real codebases with known expected outcomes
- Test CLI argument parsing and error handling for invalid inputs
- Verify output format consistency and completeness
- Test integration with git repositories in various states

**Git Integration Workflow**

- Create backups before modifications and verify rollback functionality
- Handle git repositories with uncommitted changes or merge conflicts
- Test branch detection and switching scenarios
- Verify atomic operations don't leave repositories in inconsistent states

**Configuration Synchronization**

- Test team configuration distribution and individual preference preservation
- Verify conflict resolution mechanisms work correctly
- Test configuration updates propagate correctly across team members
- Handle network failures and offline scenarios gracefully

**Performance Optimization Loop**

- Test self-analysis and improvement suggestions generation
- Verify cache directive optimization actually improves performance
- Test token usage reduction recommendations
- Validate that optimizations don't reduce functionality

### Feature Tests

**Complete Analysis Workflow**

- User runs `claude-md-update analyze` on a new project and receives actionable recommendations
- User applies suggestions and sees improved Claude Code performance in subsequent sessions
- Team lead distributes updated standards and all team members receive synchronized updates
- DevOps engineer integrates tool into CI/CD pipeline and receives automated validation reports

**Interactive Configuration Setup**

- New user runs initial setup and gets guided through configuration options
- Advanced user customizes settings for specific project requirements
- Team admin sets up shared configuration and distributes to team members

**Rollback and Recovery Scenarios**

- User applies changes that cause issues and successfully rolls back to previous state
- System recovers from corrupted configuration files or incomplete operations
- Git repository remains stable through all operations including failures

### Mocking Requirements

**Claude API Integration**

- Mock Claude API responses for content analysis and generation features
- Test rate limiting, network failures, and authentication issues
- Simulate various response qualities and content suggestions

**File System Operations**

- Mock file system for testing edge cases without affecting real files
- Test disk space issues, permission problems, and concurrent access
- Simulate various git repository states and configurations

**Network Requests**

- Mock network calls for team configuration synchronization
- Test offline behavior and graceful degradation
- Simulate slow networks and timeout scenarios

### Performance Tests

**Large Repository Handling**

- Test analysis performance on repositories with extensive git history
- Verify memory usage stays reasonable with large codebases
- Test concurrent operations and resource contention

**Cache Effectiveness**

- Verify caching reduces analysis time on subsequent runs
- Test cache invalidation triggers work correctly
- Measure actual performance improvements from optimizations

### Security Tests

**Data Privacy Validation**

- Verify no sensitive code content is transmitted externally without consent
- Test configuration file permissions and access controls
- Validate API key handling and storage security

**Git Repository Safety**

- Test atomic operations maintain repository integrity
- Verify rollback functionality works in edge cases
- Test behavior with corrupted or invalid git repositories
