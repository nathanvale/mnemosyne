# Spec Requirements Document

> Spec: Code Review Critical Fixes
> Created: 2025-08-14
> Status: Planning

## Overview

Address critical security, testing, and architectural issues identified in PR #139 for the @studio/code-review package. This spec focuses on resolving high-risk problems that must be fixed before the package can be considered production-ready.

## User Stories

### Developer Security Story

As a developer using the code-review package, I want to ensure no security test artifacts or hardcoded credentials exist in the codebase, so that security scanners don't flag false positives and best practices are followed.

The developer runs the code review tools without encountering hardcoded test credentials that could trigger security alerts or set bad precedents for credential management. All test examples are clearly marked and isolated in appropriate test fixture directories.

### Test Confidence Story

As a maintainer of the code-review package, I want comprehensive test coverage for all critical functionality, so that I can confidently make changes and catch regressions early.

The maintainer can run a full test suite that covers security analysis, CLI commands, CodeRabbit integration, and report generation. Tests provide clear feedback on failures and maintain at least 80% code coverage for critical paths.

### Async Operations Story

As a user running PR analysis, I want the CLI tools to handle long-running operations asynchronously with proper error handling, so that the process doesn't block and provides clear feedback on progress and errors.

The user executes PR analysis commands that run asynchronously, provide timeout protection, show progress indicators, and gracefully handle errors with clear messaging about what went wrong and how to fix it.

## Spec Scope

1. **Security Remediation** - Remove all hardcoded credentials and create proper test fixture structure
2. **Test Coverage Implementation** - Add comprehensive unit and integration tests achieving >80% coverage
3. **Async Architecture Refactor** - Replace all synchronous subprocess execution with async patterns
4. **Environment Validation** - Implement robust validation for all environment variables and configurations
5. **Dependency Audit** - Ensure all runtime dependencies are properly declared and versioned

## Out of Scope

- Package splitting into multiple sub-packages (future refactor)
- Performance optimization for large PRs (future enhancement)
- Plugin architecture for custom rules (future feature)
- Monitoring and alerting implementation (production deployment phase)
- Caching strategy for repeated analysis (optimization phase)

## Expected Deliverable

1. All security test artifacts removed or relocated to clearly marked test fixtures directory
2. Test suite with >80% coverage for critical functionality, passing in both Wallaby.js and Vitest
3. All CLI commands using async/await patterns with proper error boundaries and timeouts
4. Clear startup validation that fails fast with helpful error messages for missing configurations
5. Complete dependency audit with all runtime dependencies properly declared
