# Technical Specification

This is the technical specification for the spec detailed in @.agent-os/specs/2025-08-14-code-review-critical-fixes/spec.md

> Created: 2025-08-14
> Version: 1.0.0

## Technical Requirements

### Security Remediation
- Identify and remove all files containing hardcoded credentials (even test ones)
- Create a dedicated `test-fixtures/` directory for security test examples
- Add clear warnings and documentation for any test security examples
- Implement pre-commit hooks to prevent accidental credential commits

### Test Coverage Implementation
- Achieve minimum 80% code coverage for critical paths
- Write unit tests for all exported functions and classes
- Create integration tests for complete CLI workflows
- Implement test fixtures for mocking external dependencies
- Ensure tests work in both Wallaby.js and Vitest environments

### Async Architecture Requirements
- Replace all `execFileSync` calls with `execFile` using promisify
- Implement proper error boundaries with try/catch blocks
- Add configurable timeouts for all external operations
- Create progress indicators for long-running operations
- Implement graceful shutdown handling for interrupted processes

### Environment Validation
- Create a validation schema using Zod for all environment variables
- Implement startup validation that runs before any operations
- Provide clear, actionable error messages for missing/invalid configs
- Support .env files for local development with example templates
- Document all required environment variables with descriptions

### Performance Criteria
- CLI commands must start within 2 seconds
- Async operations must show progress within 5 seconds
- All operations must have configurable timeout (default: 30 seconds)
- Error messages must appear within 1 second of failure

## Approach Options

### Test Framework Approach

**Option A:** Jest with custom configuration
- Pros: Most popular, extensive ecosystem, good mocking support
- Cons: Slower than alternatives, configuration complexity

**Option B:** Vitest with Wallaby.js support (Selected)
- Pros: Fast, ESM native, compatible with existing setup, Wallaby.js integration
- Cons: Smaller ecosystem than Jest

**Rationale:** Vitest is already used in the monorepo, provides excellent performance, and integrates well with Wallaby.js for real-time test feedback.

### Async Implementation Approach

**Option A:** Callbacks with error-first pattern
- Pros: Node.js traditional pattern, wide support
- Cons: Callback hell, harder to reason about

**Option B:** Promises with async/await (Selected)
- Pros: Clean syntax, better error handling, easier testing
- Cons: Requires proper error boundaries

**Rationale:** Async/await provides the cleanest code structure and best aligns with modern JavaScript practices used throughout the codebase.

### Environment Validation Approach

**Option A:** Manual validation with if/else checks
- Pros: Simple, no dependencies
- Cons: Repetitive code, inconsistent error messages

**Option B:** Schema-based validation with Zod (Selected)
- Pros: Type-safe, consistent validation, clear error messages
- Cons: Additional dependency (already in use)

**Rationale:** Zod is already a dependency and provides excellent TypeScript integration with clear, consistent validation patterns.

## External Dependencies

### Existing Dependencies to Verify
- **zod** (^3.25.0) - Already declared, used for schema validation
- **typescript** - Ensure version matches monorepo (^5.8.3)

### New Dependencies to Add
- **tsx** (^4.x) - Required for CLI script execution in development
- **dotenv** (^16.x) - Environment variable loading from .env files
- **ora** (^8.x) - Terminal spinner for progress indication
- **chalk** (^5.x) - Terminal output formatting for better UX

### Development Dependencies
- **@types/node** - Node.js TypeScript definitions
- **@vitest/coverage-v8** - Code coverage reporting
- **msw** (^2.x) - API mocking for integration tests

```

### Error Handling Strategy
- Use custom error classes for different error types
- Include error codes for programmatic handling
- Provide suggested fixes in error messages
- Log errors with appropriate severity levels
- Implement retry logic for transient failures

### Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for pure functions and utilities
- Integration tests for CLI commands with mocked externals
- End-to-end tests for critical user paths
- Snapshot tests for report generation
- Performance tests for large PR analysis
