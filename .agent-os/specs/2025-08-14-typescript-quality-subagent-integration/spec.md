# Spec Requirements Document

> Spec: TypeScript Quality Sub-agent Integration System
> Created: 2025-08-14
> Status: Planning

## Overview

Extend the existing claude-hooks quality checking system with intelligent sub-agent analysis for unfixable TypeScript errors. This hybrid system maintains the proven auto-fix capabilities while adding contextual reasoning for complex TypeScript issues that require human-level understanding.

## User Stories

### Intelligent TypeScript Error Resolution

As a developer using Claude Code, I want TypeScript errors that can't be auto-fixed to be analyzed by an intelligent sub-agent, so that I receive contextual explanations and actionable solutions instead of raw compiler messages.

When the quality checker encounters TypeScript errors after attempting auto-fixes, it escalates these to a specialized sub-agent that:

- Analyzes the error context using the existing TypeScript cache and file mappings
- Provides human-readable explanations of complex type errors
- Suggests specific code changes with reasoning
- Understands project patterns and imports through codebase analysis

### Cost-Effective Progressive Enhancement

As a project maintainer, I want the system to intelligently decide when to use sub-agent analysis, so that we optimize for both effectiveness and API costs.

The system follows the "auto-fix first, then reason" principle where:

- ~85-90% of quality issues are resolved automatically (Prettier, ESLint --fix, simple imports)
- Only ~10-15% require intelligent reasoning (complex type errors, architectural issues)
- Sub-agent analysis is triggered only for specific error patterns that benefit from contextual understanding

### Seamless Developer Experience

As a Claude Code user, I want the enhanced quality system to work transparently within my existing workflow, so that I benefit from intelligent analysis without changing my development process.

The integration preserves the existing hook architecture while adding:

- Contextual error analysis in the same terminal output
- Intelligent suggestions alongside traditional error messages
- Maintained performance through smart caching and selective sub-agent usage

## Spec Scope

1. **Sub-agent Integration Point** - Extend the existing quality checker's `printSummary()` function to trigger sub-agent analysis for unfixable errors
2. **Contextual Error Analysis** - Leverage existing TypeScript cache, config mappings, and file system context to provide rich analysis data to sub-agents
3. **Progressive Enhancement Pattern** - Implement cost-effective escalation where complex errors get intelligent analysis while simple issues remain auto-fixed
4. **Task Tool Integration** - Use Claude Code's Task tool for sub-agent orchestration with proper prompt engineering for TypeScript error context
5. **Developer Experience Preservation** - Maintain existing hook performance and terminal output patterns while adding intelligent insights

## Out of Scope

- Complete replacement of existing quality checking system
- Real-time sub-agent analysis for all quality issues (cost prohibitive)
- Support for non-TypeScript error analysis (initial MVP focus)
- Advanced agent orchestration patterns (Task tool provides sufficient capability)
- Custom prompt engineering frameworks (use Claude Code's existing prompt engineering)

## Expected Deliverable

1. Enhanced quality checker that seamlessly integrates sub-agent analysis for unfixable TypeScript errors while preserving existing auto-fix capabilities
2. Cost-effective system targeting ~10-15% of quality checks that require reasoning, maintaining performance for the majority of auto-fixable issues
3. Developer-friendly terminal output that combines traditional error messages with contextual AI analysis and actionable suggestions
