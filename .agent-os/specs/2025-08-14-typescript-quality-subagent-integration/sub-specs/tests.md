## Test Coverage

### Unit Tests

**ErrorClassifier**

- Should identify auto-fixable errors (Prettier, ESLint patterns)
- Should recognize TypeScript errors worthy of sub-agent analysis
- Should categorize dependency warnings separately
- Should extract relevant context for sub-agent prompts
- Should handle malformed error messages gracefully
- Should respect project-specific escalation patterns

**SubAgentOrchestrator**

- Should format Task tool prompts with rich context
- Should handle Task tool responses and extract actionable insights
- Should integrate sub-agent analysis with existing error output
- Should track usage metrics and API costs
- Should implement circuit breaker for failed Task tool calls
- Should gracefully degrade when sub-agent analysis is unavailable

**ContextBuilder**

- Should extract file content and TypeScript configuration context
- Should identify related imports and project patterns
- Should leverage existing TypeScript cache for config mapping
- Should build rich context without excessive file system operations
- Should handle files with missing or invalid TypeScript configurations

**Integration with Existing QualityChecker**

- Should preserve existing auto-fix functionality completely
- Should trigger sub-agent analysis only after auto-fixes are attempted
- Should maintain existing terminal output format while adding insights
- Should not break existing hook behavior when sub-agent is unavailable
- Should handle errors in sub-agent integration without breaking quality checks

### Integration Tests

**End-to-End Quality Check Flow**

- Should run complete quality check with auto-fixes followed by sub-agent analysis
- Should handle mixed scenarios (some auto-fixable, some requiring reasoning)
- Should maintain performance characteristics of existing system
- Should produce coherent output combining traditional errors and AI insights

**TypeScript Cache Integration**

- Should correctly use existing TypeScript config cache for context building
- Should leverage intelligent config mapping (webview, test, main configs)
- Should maintain cache consistency when used by sub-agent context builder

**Task Tool Communication**

- Should successfully invoke Task tool with properly formatted prompts
- Should handle Task tool timeouts and failures gracefully
- Should parse and integrate Task tool responses into quality check output
- Should track successful vs failed sub-agent invocations

**Hook System Integration**

- Should work seamlessly within PostToolUse hook context
- Should preserve existing exit codes and hook behavior
- Should maintain compatibility with Claude Code's hook system
- Should handle various file types (components, tests, services) appropriately

### Feature Tests

**Progressive Enhancement Workflow**

- Should demonstrate 85-90% of issues resolved by auto-fixes
- Should escalate only 10-15% of errors to sub-agent analysis
- Should show improved developer experience for complex TypeScript errors
- Should maintain or improve overall quality check performance

**Cost-Effectiveness Analysis**

- Should track sub-agent usage patterns over time
- Should demonstrate measurable improvement in TypeScript error resolution
- Should validate cost-efficiency of selective sub-agent usage
- Should provide metrics for optimization and tuning

**Developer Experience Scenarios**

- Should handle common TypeScript errors with enhanced explanations
- Should provide actionable suggestions for complex type issues
- Should maintain familiar terminal output patterns
- Should work consistently across different file types and project structures

### Mocking Requirements

**Task Tool Mocking**

- **Mock Strategy**: Create mock Task tool responses for different error scenarios
- **Success Cases**: Mock successful analysis with various TypeScript error types
- **Failure Cases**: Mock timeouts, malformed responses, and unavailable states
- **Response Patterns**: Mock typical sub-agent analysis responses with explanations and suggestions

**File System Mocking**

- **Mock Strategy**: Use existing file system mocks from quality-check system
- **Context**: Mock file reading for context building without actual file operations
- **TypeScript Configs**: Mock various tsconfig.json scenarios for context testing

**TypeScript Compiler Mocking**

- **Mock Strategy**: Reuse existing TypeScript compiler mocks from quality-check tests
- **Error Patterns**: Mock specific TypeScript diagnostic patterns that trigger sub-agent analysis
- **Config Scenarios**: Mock different TypeScript configuration contexts

### Performance Testing

**Sub-agent Invocation Overhead**

- Should measure latency added by sub-agent analysis
- Should validate circuit breaker effectiveness under failure conditions
- Should test graceful degradation performance
- Should measure memory usage impact of context building

**Scalability Testing**

- Should test behavior with large numbers of TypeScript errors
- Should validate selective escalation maintains performance
- Should test concurrent hook executions with sub-agent analysis

### Error Handling Testing

**Task Tool Failure Scenarios**

- Should handle Task tool unavailable gracefully
- Should handle Task tool timeout scenarios
- Should handle malformed Task tool responses
- Should maintain existing functionality when sub-agent fails

**Context Building Failures**

- Should handle missing TypeScript configurations
- Should handle corrupted cache states
- Should handle file system permission errors
- Should continue with reduced context when full context unavailable

### Integration with Existing Test Infrastructure

**Wallaby.js Compatibility**

- Should work correctly when tests are run via Wallaby.js
- Should handle Wallaby.js environment detection for testing
- Should maintain test performance with sub-agent mocking

**Vitest Compatibility**

- Should run all tests successfully in Vitest environment
- Should handle ES modules imports correctly
- Should work with existing test utilities and mocks

**CI/CD Testing**

- Should pass in CI environment with mocked Task tool
- Should handle environment variables for test vs production behavior
- Should validate deployment readiness through integration tests
