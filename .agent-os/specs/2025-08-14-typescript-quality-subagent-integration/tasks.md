# Spec Tasks

These are the tasks to be completed for the spec detailed in @.agent-os/specs/2025-08-14-typescript-quality-subagent-integration/spec.md

> Created: 2025-08-14
> Status: Ready for Implementation

## Tasks

- [x] 1. Create Error Classification System
  - [x] 1.1 Write tests for error pattern recognition and classification logic
  - [x] 1.2 Implement ErrorClassifier interface with pattern matching for TypeScript errors
  - [x] 1.3 Create escalation criteria logic (auto-fixable vs needs-reasoning vs dependency-warning)
  - [x] 1.4 Implement context extraction from existing TypeScript cache system
  - [x] 1.5 Add cost-tracking mechanisms to monitor sub-agent usage patterns
  - [x] 1.6 Verify all tests pass and error classification works correctly

- [x] 2. Build Sub-agent Context Enrichment
  - [x] 2.1 Write tests for context building with TypeScript cache integration
  - [x] 2.2 Implement SubAgentContext interface and context builder
  - [x] 2.3 Integrate with existing TypeScriptConfigCache for intelligent config mapping
  - [x] 2.4 Add file content extraction and import analysis for rich context
  - [x] 2.5 Create project pattern detection for common monorepo structures
  - [x] 2.6 Verify all tests pass and context enrichment provides comprehensive data

- [x] 3. Implement Task Tool Integration
  - [x] 3.1 Write tests for Task tool communication and prompt engineering
  - [x] 3.2 Create SubAgentOrchestrator with Task tool invocation logic
  - [x] 3.3 Design context-rich prompts for TypeScript error analysis
  - [x] 3.4 Implement response parsing and insight extraction from Task tool
  - [x] 3.5 Add error handling for Task tool failures and timeouts
  - [x] 3.6 Verify all tests pass and Task tool integration works reliably

- [ ] 4. Integrate with Existing Quality Check System
  - [ ] 4.1 Write tests for seamless integration with existing printSummary function
  - [ ] 4.2 Extend quality-check/index.ts to trigger sub-agent analysis for unfixable errors
  - [ ] 4.3 Preserve existing auto-fix functionality and terminal output patterns
  - [ ] 4.4 Implement output blending that combines traditional errors with AI insights
  - [ ] 4.5 Add circuit breaker pattern for graceful degradation
  - [ ] 4.6 Verify all tests pass and existing hook behavior is completely preserved

- [ ] 5. Implement Performance Optimization and Metrics
  - [ ] 5.1 Write tests for usage tracking and cost optimization
  - [ ] 5.2 Add selective escalation logic to target 10-15% of quality checks
  - [ ] 5.3 Implement usage metrics collection and cost tracking
  - [ ] 5.4 Create performance monitoring for sub-agent analysis overhead
  - [ ] 5.5 Add configuration options for escalation sensitivity and cost controls
  - [ ] 5.6 Verify all tests pass and performance targets are met
