> Spec: Test Suite Transaction Isolation and Robustness Enhancement
> Created: 2025-08-03
> Status: Planning

## Overview

Fix the remaining 28 failing tests in the mood scoring algorithm test suite by implementing proper transaction isolation between TestDataFactory and storage services, enhancing test robustness, and aligning database integration expectations with actual business logic behavior.

## User Stories

### Storage Service Transaction Isolation

As a developer writing integration tests, I want storage services to properly validate Memory existence within the same transaction context, so that tests can reliably create and use test data without transaction isolation failures.

The current issue is that storage services validate Memory existence but cannot see Memory records created by TestDataFactory in different transactions, causing validation failures during test execution.

### Robust Test Data Creation

As a developer maintaining the test suite, I want TestDataFactory to handle Memory creation robustly with proper error handling and validation, so that tests don't fail due to null returns or data inconsistencies.

Currently, TestDataFactory occasionally returns null for Memory creation, causing downstream test failures when tests expect valid Memory objects.

### Aligned Test Expectations

As a developer running integration tests, I want test expectations to match the actual business logic behavior, so that tests accurately validate system functionality rather than testing incorrect assumptions.

Some database integration tests have expectations that don't align with the actual implemented business logic, causing false test failures.

## Spec Scope

1. **Transaction Context Enhancement** - Modify storage services to accept optional transaction context parameters for proper isolation
2. **TestDataFactory Robustness** - Implement comprehensive error handling and validation in Memory creation methods
3. **Database Integration Test Alignment** - Update test expectations to match actual business logic implementation
4. **Delta History Precision** - Fix calculation precision issues in significance calculations for delta history tracking
5. **Comprehensive Test Suite Validation** - Ensure all 28 failing tests pass with proper transaction handling

## Out of Scope

- Changing core business logic behavior to match incorrect test expectations
- Major architectural changes to the transaction system
- Performance optimizations beyond fixing the identified issues
- Adding new features to the mood scoring algorithm

## Expected Deliverable

1. **Zero failing tests** - Complete test suite passes with 0/28 previously failing tests
2. **Enhanced storage services** - All storage services support optional transaction context for proper isolation
3. **Robust TestDataFactory** - Memory creation methods include comprehensive error handling and never return null unexpectedly
4. **Validated business logic alignment** - All database integration tests accurately reflect implemented business logic behavior
