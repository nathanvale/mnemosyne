# MCP Foundation Layer Spec

> Spec: MCP Foundation Layer  
> Created: 2025-08-08  
> Status: Completed Implementation

## Overview

Create foundational infrastructure for Phase 3 AI agent integration by providing structured emotional intelligence APIs, mood context tokens, and relational timelines. This layer bridges Phase 2's emotional intelligence extraction with Phase 3's agent integration, transforming raw memory data into agent-ready context through mood tokenization, relational timeline construction, and emotional vocabulary extraction.

## User Stories

### Agent-Ready Emotional Intelligence

As a **Phase 3 Claude integration developer**, I want structured emotional intelligence APIs so that AI agents can access mood, timeline, and vocabulary data through standardized endpoints with comprehensive emotional context.

The system provides:

- Agent context APIs accessible via `GET /api/agent-context/{participantId}?conversationGoal=support`
- Structured emotional context with mood tokens, timeline events, and emotional vocabulary
- Context optimization for different agent types and conversation objectives
- Performance-optimized responses (<200ms) with multi-level caching strategy

### MCP Server Foundation Architecture

As a **future MCP server developer**, I want extensible foundation architecture so that the current HTTP/TRPC endpoints can evolve into full MCP servers without breaking changes.

The system supports:

- MCP-compatible resource definitions for emotional intelligence data
- Tool framework for emotional analysis capabilities exposed through MCP protocol
- Protocol interfaces ready for seamless upgrade to full MCP server functionality
- Resource management framework supporting emotional-memory, mood-context, and timeline resources

### Comprehensive Context Assembly

As an **AI conversation system**, I want comprehensive emotional context assembly so that agents can understand relationship dynamics, emotional history, and tone-consistent communication patterns.

The system enables:

- Multi-component context integration combining mood tokens, relational timelines, and emotional vocabulary
- Context sizing and relevance filtering for different agent types and token limits
- Quality validation ensuring assembled contexts provide meaningful emotional intelligence
- Customization based on conversation goals and participant preferences

## Spec Scope

### In Scope

**Mood Context Token Generation**:

- Current mood, mood trend, and mood direction token creation with configurable complexity levels
- Recent mood tags and emotional trajectory summaries optimized for agent consumption
- Token validation and consistency checks ensuring reliable emotional intelligence
- Configurable detail levels (basic/detailed/comprehensive) for different agent types

**Relational Timeline Construction**:

- Chronological emotional event timelines with participant-scoped views and key moment identification
- Cross-participant interaction tracking and relationship dynamics analysis
- Timeline querying and filtering capabilities for agent context selection and relevance
- Timeline summarization optimized for agent consumption with emotional significance scoring

**Emotional Vocabulary Extraction**:

- Participant-specific emotional vocabularies and tone-consistent language patterns
- Emotional themes, mood descriptors, and relationship terms extraction for authentic responses
- Vocabulary evolution tracking over time for context continuity and tone consistency
- Agent response recommendations based on participant communication style and emotional vocabulary

**Agent Context Assembly**:

- Comprehensive context building combining mood tokens, timeline summaries, and vocabulary
- Context sizing and relevance filtering for different agent types and conversation goals
- Multi-level caching strategy (in-memory, database, component-level) for responsive agent interactions
- Context quality validation ensuring assembled contexts provide meaningful emotional intelligence

**HTTP/TRPC Foundation Endpoints**:

- Type-safe TRPC routers for structured emotional data APIs with authentication and rate limiting
- Agent context endpoints optimized for different conversation goals and agent requirements
- OpenAPI documentation and integration guides for agent development
- Usage analytics and performance monitoring for production readiness

### Out of Scope

**Full MCP Server Implementation**:

- Complete MCP protocol compliance and advanced server functionality beyond foundation layer
- Multi-agent coordination and complex agent orchestration capabilities
- Real-time streaming or live context updates requiring complex event management
- Advanced resource management beyond foundational emotional intelligence resources

**Production MCP Features**:

- Distributed MCP server deployment and enterprise-grade load balancing
- Advanced security and permission management beyond basic agent authentication
- Complex agent workflow orchestration and multi-agent task management
- Enterprise integration features and third-party MCP server connectivity

## Expected Deliverable

1. **Agent-ready emotional intelligence APIs** - Verify structured endpoints provide comprehensive emotional context for AI consumption
2. **MCP foundation architecture** - Ensure extensible foundation supports seamless upgrade to full MCP server functionality
3. **Context assembly performance** - Validate <200ms response times with 80%+ cache hit rates for agent context requests
4. **Quality context generation** - Confirm assembled contexts provide coherent emotional intelligence enabling meaningful AI conversations
