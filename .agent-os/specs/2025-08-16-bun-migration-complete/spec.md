# Spec Requirements Document

> Spec: Complete Bun Migration with Advanced Optimizations
> Created: 2025-08-16
> Status: Planning

## Overview

Migrate the entire Mnemosyne monorepo from TypeScript/Node.js to Bun, eliminating all ES module resolution issues while implementing advanced performance optimizations and developer experience improvements that go beyond basic migration. This spec includes innovative features we haven't considered yet, including native binary compilation, edge deployment readiness, and AI-assisted development workflows.

## User Stories

### Clean ES Module Resolution

As a developer, I want to write standard TypeScript imports without any file extensions and have them work seamlessly in both development and production, so that I can focus on building features rather than fighting module resolution issues.

**Current Problem**: We have `.js` extensions scattered throughout compiled output, requiring post-processing scripts and causing constant friction.

**Solution Workflow**: Developer writes clean TypeScript, Bun handles all compilation and module resolution automatically, output works everywhere without any post-processing or manual intervention.

### Lightning-Fast Development Iteration

As a developer, I want sub-second hot reload and instant test execution, so that I can maintain flow state and ship features faster.

**Current Problem**: Waiting 3-5 seconds for TypeScript compilation breaks concentration and slows down development.

**Solution Workflow**: Developer saves file, Bun hot-reloads in <100ms, tests run instantly with native test runner, feedback loop becomes nearly instantaneous.

### Production-Ready Binary Deployment

As a DevOps engineer, I want to compile our TypeScript applications into single native binaries, so that we can deploy without Node.js runtime dependencies and achieve better performance.

**Current Problem**: Deploying Node.js applications requires managing runtime versions, node_modules, and dealing with cold start times.

**Solution Workflow**: Run `bun build --compile`, get a single executable binary, deploy it anywhere with zero dependencies, enjoy 4x faster cold starts.

## Spec Scope

1. **Complete Bun Migration** - Replace Node.js/tsc with Bun across all 17 packages
2. **Extension Elimination** - Remove ALL `.js` extensions from source and eliminate need for them
3. **Binary Compilation** - Implement native binary compilation for production deployments
4. **Edge Deployment** - Prepare packages for edge runtime deployment (Cloudflare Workers, Deno Deploy)
5. **AI Development Integration** - Set up Bun-powered AI coding assistants and automated testing
6. **Performance Monitoring** - Implement comprehensive performance tracking and optimization
7. **Security Hardening** - Add runtime security features using Bun's capabilities
8. **Developer Experience** - Revolutionary improvements to debugging, profiling, and iteration speed
9. **External Package Testing** - Dedicated test package for integration validation
10. **Advanced Caching** - Implement multi-layer caching strategy for maximum performance

## Out of Scope

- Changing the monorepo structure (Turborepo stays)
- Modifying the dual consumption architecture fundamentally
- Migrating away from Prisma or other core dependencies
- Changing the Git workflow or CI/CD provider
- Converting to a different programming language

## Expected Deliverable

1. **Zero Module Resolution Issues**: No more `.js` extension problems, ever
2. **10x Performance Improvement**: Sub-second builds, instant hot reload, faster tests
3. **Native Binary Outputs**: Deployable executables for all CLI tools and services
4. **Edge-Ready Packages**: All packages can run in edge environments
5. **AI-Powered Development**: Integrated AI tools for code generation and testing
6. **Comprehensive Testing**: External test package validating all integrations
7. **Security Enhancements**: Runtime security monitoring and protection
8. **Developer Productivity**: 50% reduction in development cycle time
