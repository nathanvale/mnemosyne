- Task 2: Foundation Packages (4 hours)

### Phase 2: Core Migration (Day 2-3)

- Task 3: Service Layer (4 hours)
- Task 4: Application Layer (4 hours)
- Task 5: External Tests (4 hours)

## Critical Success Factors

### Must-Have Completions

- ✅ Zero .js extension errors
- ✅ All packages build with Bun
- ✅ All tests pass
- ✅ External test package validates everything
- ✅ Native binaries compile successfully
- ✅ 10x performance improvement achieved

### Risk Mitigation

1. **Prisma Compatibility**
   - Risk: Prisma client generation issues
   - Mitigation: Custom build script with special handling
   - Fallback: Keep Node.js for Prisma operations only

2. **MSW Compatibility**
   - Risk: Mock Service Worker incompatibility
   - Mitigation: External dependency handling
   - Fallback: Alternative mocking solution

3. **CI/CD Pipeline**
   - Risk: GitHub Actions Bun support
   - Mitigation: Use official oven-sh/setup-bun action
   - Fallback: Docker containers with Bun

4. **Team Adoption**
   - Risk: Learning curve for developers
   - Mitigation: Comprehensive documentation and training
   - Fallback: Gradual migration with Node.js compatibility

## Validation Checklist

After each major task:

- [ ] Build succeeds in < 1 second
- [ ] Tests pass in < 500ms
- [ ] No .js extensions in source or imports
- [ ] Memory usage < 100MB
- [ ] External tests pass
- [ ] Performance benchmarks met
- [ ] Security audit clean
- [ ] Documentation updated

## Rollback Plan

If critical issues arise:

1. **Immediate Rollback** (< 5 minutes)

   ```bash
   git checkout main
   pnpm install
   pnpm build
   ```

2. **Partial Rollback** (< 30 minutes)
   - Keep Bun for development
   - Use Node.js for production
   - Maintain dual compatibility

3. **Gradual Rollback** (< 1 day)
   - Revert packages one by one
   - Identify specific issues
   - Fix and retry migration

### Documentation Deliverables

1. Migration Guide
2. Performance Report
3. Lessons Learned
4. Best Practices
5. Troubleshooting Guide

## Post-Migration Tasks

After successful migration:

1. Remove Node.js dependencies
2. Update CI/CD pipelines
3. Train team on Bun
4. Monitor production performance
5. Document new workflows
6. Celebrate! 🎉

## Notes

This migration represents a paradigm shift in our development workflow:

- **From**: TypeScript → Compile → Node.js → Run
- **To**: TypeScript → Bun (direct execution)

The elimination of the compilation step alone will save hundreds of developer hours annually.

### Key Innovations

1. **Native Binary Compilation** - Deploy without runtime dependencies
2. **Edge Runtime Support** - Run anywhere (Cloudflare, Deno, browsers)
3. **AI Integration** - Local LLM for code generation
4. **Security Hardening** - Runtime permission system
5. **Performance Monitoring** - Real-time metrics dashboard

This is not just a tool migration - it's a complete modernization of our development stack.
