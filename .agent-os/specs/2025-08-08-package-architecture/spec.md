# Package Architecture Spec

> Spec: Monorepo Package Architecture with @studio/\* Namespace
> Created: 2025-08-08
> Status: Completed Implementation

## Overview

Implement comprehensive monorepo package architecture using pnpm workspaces with 15+ specialized @studio/\* packages. This architecture provides modular code organization, shared configurations, cross-package dependencies, and efficient development workflows through workspace protocols and TypeScript project references.

## User Stories

### Modular Code Organization

As a **software architect**, I want modular package organization so that I can maintain separation of concerns, enable independent versioning, and facilitate code reuse across applications with clear dependency boundaries.

The architecture provides:

- 15+ specialized packages under @studio/\* namespace for different domains
- Clear separation between apps, packages, and configuration
- Workspace protocol (workspace:\*) for internal dependencies
- TypeScript project references for cross-package type safety

### Shared Configuration Management

As a **development team**, I want centralized configuration packages so that I can maintain consistent standards across all packages with single-source-of-truth for TypeScript, ESLint, and Prettier configurations.

The system supports:

- @studio/typescript-config with base, library, and Next.js configurations
- @studio/eslint-config with base, library, and Next exports
- @studio/prettier-config for unified formatting rules
- Configuration inheritance allowing package-specific overrides

### Cross-Package Development

As a **developer**, I want seamless cross-package development so that I can work on multiple packages simultaneously with hot module replacement, type safety, and automatic rebuilds maintaining productivity.

The system enables:

- Direct source imports during development with path mappings
- Automatic dependency building through Turborepo orchestration
- Hot module replacement across package boundaries
- Shared test utilities and configurations

### Domain-Specific Packages

As a **feature developer**, I want domain-specific packages so that I can work on isolated functionality with clear APIs, independent testing, and minimal coupling to other system components.

The architecture delivers:

- Database package (@studio/db) with Prisma client and operations
- Logger package (@studio/logger) with dual Node.js/browser support
- UI components (@studio/ui) with Storybook integration
- Memory processing (@studio/memory) with mood analysis algorithms

## Spec Scope

### In Scope

**Core Package Structure**:

- Apps directory with studio (Next.js) and docs (Docusaurus) applications
- Packages directory with 15+ specialized @studio/\* packages
- pnpm-workspace.yaml configuration for workspace management
- Consistent package.json structure with standardized scripts

**Configuration Packages**:

- @studio/typescript-config with three configuration exports
- @studio/eslint-config with base, library, and Next.js rules
- @studio/prettier-config for code formatting standards
- @studio/test-config with shared Vitest configuration

**Domain Packages**:

- @studio/db - Prisma database client and operations
- @studio/logger - Dual logging system for Node.js and browser
- @studio/ui - React component library with Storybook
- @studio/scripts - CLI utilities and data processing tools
- @studio/mocks - MSW handlers for API mocking

**Processing Packages**:

- @studio/memory - Memory extraction and mood analysis
- @studio/schema - Zod schemas for data validation
- @studio/validation - Memory validation and quality assessment
- @studio/mcp - Model Context Protocol foundation layer

**Infrastructure Packages**:

- @studio/claude-hooks - Claude integration hooks
- @studio/shared - Shared TypeScript configurations
- Package-specific build outputs and type definitions
- ES modules configuration throughout monorepo

### Out of Scope

**Advanced Monorepo Features**:

- Package publishing to npm registry
- Versioning and changelog management
- Automated dependency updates beyond manual maintenance
- Package-level documentation generation

**External Package Management**:

- Private package registry hosting
- Package access control and permissions
- License compliance checking
- Security vulnerability scanning automation

**Complex Build Scenarios**:

- Custom webpack configurations per package
- Package-specific bundling strategies
- Advanced tree-shaking optimizations
- Runtime package loading mechanisms

## Expected Deliverable

1. **Modular package architecture** - Verify 15+ packages organize code by domain with clear boundaries
2. **Centralized configurations** - Ensure shared configs maintain consistency across all packages
3. **Cross-package development** - Validate seamless development with hot reload and type safety
4. **Build orchestration** - Confirm Turborepo coordinates package builds in dependency order
