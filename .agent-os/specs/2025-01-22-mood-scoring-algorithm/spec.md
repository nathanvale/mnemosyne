> Spec: Mood Scoring Algorithm
> Created: 2025-01-22
> Status: Planning

## Overview

Enhance the existing mood scoring system with contextual emotional analysis that transforms conversation content into quantifiable mood scores and emotional insights. This system will provide AI systems with reliable emotional intelligence through multi-dimensional analysis combining sentiment indicators, psychological patterns, relationship dynamics, and conversational context to enable emotionally appropriate responses.

## User Stories

### AI Conversation Systems Enhancement

As an AI conversation system, I want to access quantified emotional state data with contextual analysis, so that I can provide contextually appropriate and emotionally intelligent responses that demonstrate understanding of the user's emotional needs and relationship dynamics.

The AI system receives mood scores (0-10 scale) with emotional descriptors, confidence assessments, and relationship context that guide response tone, empathy level, and conversation approach. Delta detection identifies emotional transitions, enabling the AI to recognize and respond appropriately to mood changes, mood repair moments, and emotional support needs.

### Memory Processing Intelligence

As a memory extraction system, I want mood-aware significance weighting and emotional context enhancement, so that I can prioritize and extract memories based on their emotional importance and relationship impact.

The system processes conversation content through enhanced emotional analysis, generating mood scores that inform memory significance assessment. Emotional trajectories and delta detection identify psychologically significant moments, turning points, and relationship dynamics that enhance memory extraction quality and emotional intelligence.

### Emotional Continuity Maintenance

As a user interacting with AI systems, I want consistent emotional understanding across conversations and time, so that the AI demonstrates authentic relationship awareness and responds appropriately to my emotional state and history.

The mood scoring system maintains emotional baselines, tracks mood evolution over time, and identifies patterns that enable AI systems to provide consistent emotional understanding. Delta detection recognizes emotional transitions and mood repair moments, allowing AI to respond with appropriate sensitivity and support.

## Spec Scope

1. **Multi-Dimensional Mood Analysis** - Enhanced mood scoring combining sentiment analysis, psychological indicators, relationship context, and conversational flow
2. **Delta Detection System** - Conversation-level and timeline-based emotional transition identification with significance scoring
3. **Confidence Calibration** - Uncertainty detection and reliability assessment for mood scores and delta identification
4. **Context Integration** - Relationship dynamics analysis and participant-specific emotional baseline establishment
5. **Validation Framework** - Human validation system for accuracy assessment and continuous algorithm improvement

## Out of Scope

- Clinical psychology assessment or mental health diagnostic capabilities
- Real-time emotional processing or live conversation mood monitoring
- Advanced psychological pattern recognition beyond basic mood assessment
- Integration with external psychological assessment tools or therapeutic services
- Complex behavioral analytics or psychological research data generation

## Expected Deliverable

1. Enhanced MoodScoringAnalyzer with 80%+ human agreement correlation and multi-dimensional analysis framework
2. Functional delta detection system identifying 85%+ of significant emotional transitions with <15% false positive rate
3. Human validation framework enabling continuous accuracy improvement and edge case handling
