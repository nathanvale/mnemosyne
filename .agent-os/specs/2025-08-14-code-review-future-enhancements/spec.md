# Spec Requirements Document

> Spec: Code Review Future Enhancements
> Created: 2025-08-14
> Status: Planning

## Overview

Implement future-facing enhancements and architectural improvements for the @studio/code-review package, focusing on scalability, extensibility, and production readiness. These enhancements build upon the critical fixes and medium improvements to create an enterprise-ready solution.

## User Stories

### Package Modularity Story

As a development team, I want the code-review functionality split into focused, reusable packages, so that we can use specific features without importing the entire codebase and maintain each component independently.

The team can install just `@studio/security-analysis` for security scanning, or `@studio/coderabbit-parser` for CodeRabbit integration, without needing the full code-review package. Each package has its own release cycle, documentation, and test suite, making maintenance and updates more manageable.

### Production Monitoring Story

As a DevOps engineer, I want comprehensive monitoring and alerting for the code-review service in production, so that I can track performance, identify issues proactively, and ensure service reliability.

The engineer can view dashboards showing API call metrics, analysis duration, error rates, and resource usage. Alerts notify the team when thresholds are exceeded, and detailed logs help diagnose issues quickly. The system provides health checks and metrics endpoints for integration with existing monitoring infrastructure.

### Custom Rules Story

As a team lead, I want to define custom security and quality rules specific to our organization, so that the code review tool enforces our unique standards and practices.

The team lead can write custom rule plugins that integrate seamlessly with the existing analysis engine. Rules can be loaded dynamically, configured per-project, and shared across teams. The plugin system provides a clear API for rule development and testing utilities for validation.

## Spec Scope

1. **Package Architecture Refactoring** - Split monolithic package into focused sub-packages
2. **Production Monitoring System** - Implement comprehensive monitoring, metrics, and alerting
3. **API Rate Limiting** - Add intelligent rate limiting for external API calls
4. **Caching Strategy** - Implement multi-level caching for improved performance
5. **Plugin Architecture** - Create extensible system for custom rules and analyzers

## Out of Scope

- Migration of existing users (will be handled in separate migration plan)
- Backwards compatibility for monolithic package (clean break in major version)
- SaaS offering or hosted service (focus on self-hosted solution)
- Integration with specific enterprise tools (handled via plugins)
- Pricing or licensing changes (remain open source)

## Expected Deliverable

1. Clean package architecture with 5-7 focused sub-packages, each independently installable
2. Production monitoring with OpenTelemetry integration, health checks, and Prometheus metrics
3. Intelligent rate limiting preventing API throttling with queue management
4. Multi-level cache reducing repeated analysis time by 70%+
5. Plugin system with TypeScript SDK, example plugins, and development documentation
