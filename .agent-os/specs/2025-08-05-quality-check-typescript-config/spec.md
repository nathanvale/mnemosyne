> Spec: Quality Check TypeScript Configuration Fix
> Created: 2025-08-05
> Status: Planning

## Overview

Fix the quality check hook's TypeScript configuration issue where it attempts to type-check test files that are explicitly excluded from the TypeScript project configuration, causing false failures and hook noise.

## User Stories

### Developer Writing Tests

As a developer writing test files, I want the quality check hook to respect my TypeScript project configuration, so that I don't get false TypeScript errors for files that are intentionally excluded from type checking.

When I edit a test file that's excluded by tsconfig.json patterns like `**/*.test.ts`, the hook should skip TypeScript checking for that file but still run ESLint and other applicable checks.

### TDD Workflow Support

As a developer following TDD practices, I want the quality check hook to continue supporting dummy file generation for included source files, so that my test-driven development workflow remains uninterrupted.

The hook should maintain its existing TDD support for source files while properly handling excluded test files.

## Spec Scope

1. **TypeScript Exclusion Pattern Parsing** - Parse and respect tsconfig.json exclusion patterns when determining which files to type-check
2. **File Inclusion Validation** - Add logic to validate whether a file is included in the TypeScript project before attempting to check it
3. **Configuration Caching** - Cache parsed exclusion patterns for performance across multiple file checks
4. **Clear Logging** - Provide informative log messages when files are skipped due to TypeScript exclusions
5. **Test Coverage** - Comprehensive tests for the new exclusion logic and edge cases

## Out of Scope

- Changing the overall architecture of the quality check hook
- Modifying ESLint or other checker behaviors (only TypeScript checker affected)
- Changing TypeScript project configurations themselves
- Adding new quality check features beyond the configuration fix

## Expected Deliverable

1. Quality check hook no longer produces TypeScript errors for files excluded by tsconfig.json
2. Clear console output explaining when files are skipped due to TypeScript exclusions
3. All existing TDD and dummy file generation functionality preserved for included files
