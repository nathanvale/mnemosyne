> Spec: Fix Code Rabbit Comments for PR #107
> Created: 2025-08-06
> Status: Planning

## Overview

Address all Code Rabbit comments on PR #107 to ensure consistent naming conventions, improve script robustness, and align documentation with actual TypeScript implementation.

## User Stories

### Documentation Consistency Story

As a developer using Claude hooks, I want documentation that accurately reflects the actual API interfaces, so that I can configure hooks correctly without confusion between documented and actual property names.

**Detailed Workflow:** Developer reads configuration documentation, copies example JSON schema, applies it to their project, but encounters errors because documented properties don't match the actual TypeScript interfaces. This creates frustration and debugging time.

### Naming Convention Story

As a maintainer of the Claude hooks system, I want consistent filename conventions throughout all documentation and code, so that commands work correctly and the codebase is maintainable.

**Detailed Workflow:** Scripts and documentation reference files using underscore naming (subagent_stop.ts) while actual implementation uses hyphen convention (subagent-stop.ts), causing command failures and confusion.

### Script Robustness Story

As a user deploying Claude hooks on various systems, I want verification scripts to work regardless of system dependencies, so that I can validate deployments in any environment.

**Detailed Workflow:** User runs verification script on a system without Node.js, script fails with unclear error instead of gracefully handling the missing dependency and providing meaningful feedback.

## Spec Scope

1. **Filename Consistency Fix** - Update all documentation references from underscore to hyphen convention
2. **JSON Schema Alignment** - Align documentation schemas with actual TypeScript interfaces
3. **Script Robustness** - Add Node.js availability checks in verification scripts
4. **Configuration Documentation** - Fix property name mismatches between docs and implementation

## Out of Scope

- Changing actual implementation interfaces to match old documentation
- Adding new configuration features not already implemented
- Major refactoring of the configuration system architecture

## Expected Deliverable

1. All documentation uses consistent hyphen-based naming convention (subagent-stop.ts)
2. JSON configuration examples in CONFIGURATION.md match actual TypeScript interfaces
3. Verification script gracefully handles missing Node.js dependency
4. All Code Rabbit comments are resolved with proper fixes
