# Spec Requirements Document

> Spec: Tone-Tagged Memory Clustering
> Created: 2025-08-04
> Status: Planning

## Overview

Implement a tone-tagged memory clustering system that organizes emotional memories into psychologically coherent groups based on emotional tone, communication patterns, and relationship dynamics. This system will create meaningful emotional themes that enable AI systems to understand and respond to psychological patterns with sophistication.

## User Stories

### AI System Enhancement

As an AI conversation system, I want to access organized emotional themes, so that I can provide pattern-aware and psychologically coherent responses that demonstrate understanding of recurring emotional patterns and relationship dynamics.

The AI system will receive clustered emotional memories grouped by psychological themes, enabling it to recognize when a user exhibits familiar emotional patterns, relationship dynamics, or psychological tendencies. This allows for responses that feel genuinely understanding and emotionally intelligent.

### Memory Processing Pipeline

As a memory processing system, I want to organize extracted emotional memories into meaningful clusters, so that I can provide thematic coherence and pattern recognition capabilities that transform scattered emotional events into psychological insights.

The processing pipeline will take individual emotional memories and group them into clusters that reflect recurring themes, emotional patterns, and relationship dynamics. This creates a structured emotional intelligence foundation that supports pattern-aware AI interactions.

### Pattern Recognition System

As a pattern recognition analyzer, I want to identify recurring emotional themes and psychological tendencies, so that I can enable AI systems to understand individual psychological patterns and respond with appropriate emotional sophistication.

The system will analyze clusters to identify coping styles, relationship patterns, emotional themes, and psychological growth trajectories, providing insights that enable AI to respond with genuine emotional understanding.

## Spec Scope

1. **Multi-Dimensional Clustering Algorithm** - Implement clustering system combining emotional tone (35%), communication style (25%), relationship context (20%), psychological indicators (15%), and temporal context (5%)

2. **Emotional Pattern Analysis** - Build cross-cluster pattern recognition identifying recurring emotional themes, relationship dynamics, coping styles, and psychological tendencies

3. **Cluster Quality Assessment** - Create psychological coherence evaluation system with meaningfulness scoring, thematic consistency validation, and edge case handling

4. **Dynamic Cluster Management** - Develop adaptive clustering system that evolves with new memories and changing emotional patterns while maintaining psychological coherence

5. **Integration with Memory Processing** - Enhance @studio/memory package with clustering capabilities, pattern-aware access methods, and thematic memory organization

## Out of Scope

- Clinical psychology assessment or diagnostic psychological pattern recognition
- Complex personality modeling beyond basic pattern recognition
- Therapeutic intervention recommendations or treatment guidance
- Real-time clustering or live emotional pattern recognition
- External integration with clinical psychology platforms or research tools
- Advanced machine learning clustering beyond hierarchical clustering methods

## Expected Deliverable

1. **Psychologically Coherent Memory Clusters** - System produces memory clusters with 85%+ psychological coherence demonstrating clear emotional themes and consistency

2. **Pattern Recognition Capabilities** - System identifies recurring emotional themes and relationship patterns with 85%+ accuracy for individual psychological understanding

3. **Enhanced AI Intelligence** - Clustered memories enable AI responses that demonstrate 90%+ appropriate emotional pattern recognition and psychological sophistication
