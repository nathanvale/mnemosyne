# Spec Requirements Document

> Spec: OpenAI TTS Integration

## Overview

Integrate OpenAI Text-to-Speech API as a premium speech provider for Claude hooks while maintaining the existing macOS `say` command as a free fallback option. This enhancement will provide users with natural, high-quality voice synthesis for notifications and task completions.

## User Stories

### Premium Voice Quality for Developers

As a developer using Claude Code, I want to hear natural-sounding voice notifications, so that the audio feedback is pleasant and less disruptive to my workflow.

When I complete a task or receive a notification, instead of the robotic macOS voice, I hear a natural OpenAI voice that sounds more human-like. The system automatically falls back to macOS `say` if the API is unavailable or if I haven't configured an API key.

### Flexible Provider Selection

As a power user, I want to choose between different TTS providers based on my needs and budget, so that I can balance quality with cost.

I can configure the system to use OpenAI for important notifications and macOS for routine ones, or set up automatic fallback when API limits are reached. The configuration is simple and supports environment variables for API keys.

### Cost-Conscious Usage

As a budget-conscious developer, I want the system to cache repeated messages and provide cost estimates, so that I can manage my API usage effectively.

The system caches common messages like "Task completed" to avoid repeated API calls, and provides usage statistics so I can monitor costs. I can always fall back to the free macOS option.

## Spec Scope

1. **Provider Abstraction Layer** - Create a flexible provider system that supports multiple TTS services
2. **OpenAI TTS Provider** - Implement full OpenAI TTS API integration with all 6 voices and quality tiers
3. **Fallback Mechanism** - Automatic fallback from OpenAI to macOS when errors occur or API is unavailable
4. **Configuration System** - Extended configuration to support provider selection and API credentials
5. **Audio Caching** - Cache frequently used phrases to reduce API calls and costs

## Out of Scope

- Other TTS providers (ElevenLabs, Google Cloud, etc.) - can be added later using the provider abstraction
- Voice cloning or custom voice training
- Real-time streaming audio (using pre-generated audio only)
- GUI for provider management
- Billing integration or cost tracking dashboard

## Expected Deliverable

1. Users can configure OpenAI TTS in their Claude hooks configuration with just an API key
2. The system seamlessly falls back to macOS `say` when OpenAI is unavailable
3. All existing speech functionality continues to work with the new provider system
