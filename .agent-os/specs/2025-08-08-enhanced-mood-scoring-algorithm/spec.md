# Enhanced Mood Scoring Algorithm Spec

> Spec: Enhanced Mood Scoring Algorithm  
> Created: 2025-08-08  
> Status: Completed Implementation

## Overview

Implement sophisticated multi-dimensional emotional analysis that transforms conversational content into quantifiable mood scores and emotional intelligence. This system provides contextual emotional analysis enabling AI systems to understand and respond to human emotional states with appropriate empathy, sensitivity, and relationship awareness.

## User Stories

### Contextual Emotional Analysis

As a **memory processing system**, I want sophisticated mood scoring capabilities so that I can assess emotional states with multi-dimensional analysis combining sentiment, psychological indicators, relationship dynamics, and conversational context.

The system provides:

- 0-10 mood scale with emotional descriptors and confidence assessment
- Multi-dimensional analysis combining sentiment analysis (35%), psychological indicators (25%), relationship context (20%), conversational flow (15%), and historical patterns (5%)
- Contextual analysis considering conversation flow, participant dynamics, and emotional triggers
- Confidence scoring and uncertainty detection for mood assessment reliability

### Mood Delta Detection

As an **emotional intelligence system**, I want advanced delta detection capabilities so that I can identify emotional transitions and mood changes within conversations and across timelines.

The system supports:

- Conversation-level mood transition detection identifying emotional shifts within discussions
- Timeline-based mood tracking showing emotional evolution over days, weeks, and months
- Mood repair moment identification recognizing when emotional support or positive experiences occur
- Psychological turning point detection highlighting significant emotional breakthroughs or challenges

### AI Response Enhancement

As an **AI conversation system**, I want mood-aware emotional intelligence so that I can adapt tone, empathy level, and conversation approach based on emotional state analysis.

The system enables:

- AI accesses structured mood data with scores, deltas, and emotional context
- Response guidance based on mood analysis for appropriate emotional tone
- Emotional continuity maintained through mood tracking across conversations
- Appropriate responses generated demonstrating emotional intelligence

## Spec Scope

### In Scope

**Core Mood Scoring Algorithm**:

- Multi-dimensional emotional analysis combining sentiment, psychological indicators, and relationship context
- Weighted scoring formula: Sentiment Analysis (35%), Psychological Indicators (25%), Relationship Context (20%), Conversational Flow (15%), Historical Pattern (5%)
- 0-10 mood scale with emotional descriptors and psychological state assessment
- Confidence scoring and uncertainty detection for mood assessment reliability

**Delta Detection System**:

- Conversation-level delta detection for emotional shifts within discussions
- Timeline mood evolution tracking with trend analysis and cyclical pattern recognition
- Mood repair moment identification and emotional support recognition
- Psychological turning point detection with significance scoring and temporal context

**Emotional Context Integration**:

- Relationship dynamics consideration in mood assessment (family vs friends vs professional)
- Conversational context analysis (support seeking, celebration sharing, conflict resolution)
- Participant-specific emotional baselines and mood pattern recognition
- Emotional vocabulary and tone consistency analysis for mood validation

**Validation and Quality Framework**:

- Human validation framework for mood score accuracy assessment
- Multi-factor confidence assessment with sentiment clarity, context consistency, and indicator alignment
- Edge case handling for complex emotional situations and mixed emotional states
- Quality metrics tracking for continuous algorithm improvement

### Out of Scope

**Advanced Clinical Analysis**:

- Clinical psychology assessment or mental health diagnostic capabilities
- Complex personality modeling or psychological profiling beyond mood assessment
- Therapeutic intervention recommendations or mental health guidance
- Advanced psychological pattern recognition beyond implemented emotional analysis

**Real-Time Processing**:

- Live conversation mood analysis or real-time emotional feedback
- Streaming emotional state updates or continuous mood monitoring
- Real-time intervention systems or immediate emotional response triggers
- Live emotional coaching or therapeutic interaction capabilities

## Expected Deliverable

1. **Multi-dimensional mood analysis** - Verify sophisticated emotional analysis with weighted scoring across 5 dimensions
2. **Delta detection capabilities** - Confirm conversation-level and timeline-based emotional transition identification
3. **AI response enhancement** - Validate mood-aware emotional intelligence improves AI conversation quality
4. **Validation framework integration** - Ensure human validation framework provides accuracy assessment and continuous improvement
