# Memory Schema Definition Spec

> Spec: Memory Schema Definition  
> Created: 2025-08-08  
> Status: Completed Implementation

## Overview

Document and validate the comprehensive TypeScript schema system that transforms abstract emotional concepts into concrete, queryable data structures. This spec covers the foundational type system with 1,184 lines of sophisticated TypeScript interfaces and 54 database tables that enable all emotional intelligence components to work together.

## User Stories

### Core Schema Foundation

As a **developer integrating with the memory system**, I want to import type-safe interfaces so that I can work with emotional intelligence data with full TypeScript support and compile-time validation.

The system provides:

- `import { Memory, EmotionalContext, RelationshipDynamics } from '@studio/schema'`
- Complete TypeScript intellisense and type checking
- Runtime validation utilities with detailed error reporting
- Schema transformation functions for export compatibility

### Emotional Intelligence Structure

As a **memory processing system**, I want comprehensive emotional context schemas so that I can store and query complex psychological data with computational efficiency.

The system supports:

- Primary mood classification with intensity and complexity dimensions
- Emotional themes, markers, and contextual events tracking
- Temporal patterns and emotional progression analysis
- Relationship dynamics with communication patterns

### Database Integration

As a **data persistence layer**, I want schema definitions that align with database storage requirements so that complex emotional intelligence data can be stored and queried efficiently.

The system includes:

- 54 sophisticated database tables with complex relationships
- Memory, EmotionalContext, RelationshipDynamics, ValidationStatus tables
- MoodScore, MoodDelta, TurningPoint tracking for temporal analysis
- Clustering and validation history with quality metrics

## Spec Scope

### In Scope

**Core Memory Schema**:

- Primary Memory interface with emotional context and relationship dynamics
- Participant identification and relationship mapping structures
- Temporal context and conversation threading definitions
- Processing metadata and validation history tracking

**Emotional Intelligence Framework**:

- Mood classification (positive, negative, neutral, mixed, ambiguous) with 1-10 intensity
- Emotional themes, markers, and contextual events with evidence tracking
- Temporal patterns and emotional progression with delta detection
- Multi-dimensional mood scoring with confidence factors

**Relationship Dynamics Schema**:

- Closeness, tension, and supportiveness measurement (1-10 scales)
- Communication patterns and interaction quality definitions
- Participant roles and relationship type classifications
- Support dynamics and emotional safety assessment

**Validation & Quality Framework**:

- Validation workflow states (pending, approved, rejected, needs_refinement)
- Quality metric definitions with confidence scoring
- Refinement suggestion and improvement tracking
- Export format definitions for agent integration

### Out of Scope

**Advanced Psychological Models**:

- Clinical assessment integration or diagnostic frameworks
- Personality trait inference beyond relationship dynamics
- Advanced sentiment analysis beyond implemented emotional categorization

**Production Optimization**:

- Database indexing strategies (handled by Prisma migrations)
- Performance optimization (handled by query implementation)
- Caching strategies (future implementation)

## Expected Deliverable

1. **Comprehensive schema validation** - Verify 1,184 TypeScript interface lines match implementation
2. **Database alignment confirmation** - Ensure 54 tables properly support schema definitions
3. **Integration testing** - Validate schema works across memory, validation, and MCP packages
4. **Documentation completion** - Full type documentation with usage examples
