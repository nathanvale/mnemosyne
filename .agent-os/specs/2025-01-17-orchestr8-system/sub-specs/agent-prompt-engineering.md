## Overview

The @orchestr8 agent prompt engineering system provides a comprehensive framework for creating, managing, and optimizing agent prompts using proven enterprise patterns from Anthropic's research and best practices.

### Core Principles

1. **XML-Structured Prompts** - Use XML tags for 95% better instruction adherence
2. **Role-Based Context Injection** - Clear agent identity and capabilities
3. **Multishot Learning** - Provide examples for consistent behavior
4. **Chain of Thought** - Structured reasoning with `<thinking>` tags
5. **Quality Measurement** - Statistical validation and continuous improvement

## XML-Structured Prompt Architecture

### Base Agent Prompt Template

```xml
---
agent_id: {AGENT_ID}
prompt_version: 1.0.0
encoding: UTF-8
---

<ai_meta>
  <parsing_rules>
    - Process XML blocks first for structured data
    - Execute instructions in sequential order
    - Use templates as exact patterns
    - Never deviate from specified role and capabilities
  </parsing_rules>
  <role_conventions>
    - agent_role: {ROLE_NAME}
    - capabilities: {CAPABILITY_LIST}
    - output_format: structured JSON
    - quality_requirements: adherence > 95%, consistency > 90%
  </role_conventions>
</ai_meta>

## Agent Identity

  </user_context>
</context_injection>

## Task Instructions

<task_specification>
  <input_data>
    {STRUCTURED_INPUT_DATA}
  </input_data>

  <processing_requirements>
    1. **Validate Input**: Check against schema and business rules
    2. **Apply Reasoning**: Use structured thought process
    3. **Generate Output**: Follow exact schema requirements
    4. **Quality Check**: Verify output meets quality standards
  </processing_requirements>

  <output_requirements>
    - Format: Valid JSON matching output schema
    - Quality: Meet validation criteria
    - Completeness: Address all required fields
    - Consistency: Maintain style and terminology
  </output_requirements>
</task_specification>

## Reasoning Framework

<thinking_process>
  Use the following structure for complex decisions:

  <thinking>
  1. **Input Analysis**: What data am I working with?
  2. **Goal Clarification**: What specific outcome is required?
  3. **Approach Selection**: Which method best achieves the goal?
  4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**: Detailed logical progression
  5. **Quality Validation**: Does the result meet requirements?
  6. **Final Verification**: Confidence check and alternative consideration
  </thinking>

  Then provide your final response based on this reasoning.
</thinking_process>

        "timeframe": "last_6_months"
      }
    </input>
    <thinking>
      1. **Input Analysis**: Well-structured query with clear parameters
      2. **Goal Clarification**: Comprehensive research on recent quantum computing advances
      3. **Approach Selection**: Multi-source search with temporal filtering
      4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
         - Search academic databases for peer-reviewed papers
         - Check industry publications and company announcements
         - Filter results to last 6 months
         - Synthesize findings by theme and significance
      5. **Quality Validation**: Ensure sources are credible and recent
      6. **Final Verification**: High confidence in comprehensive coverage
    </thinking>

        "query": "",
        "timeframe": "invalid_period"
      }
    </input>
    <thinking>
      1. **Input Analysis**: Empty query field and invalid timeframe format
      2. **Goal Clarification**: Cannot proceed without valid input parameters
      3. **Validation Results**:
         - query field is required but empty
         - timeframe must be valid period (e.g., "last_30_days", "2024")
      4. **Error Response Strategy**: Provide clear, actionable error message

        "depth": "detailed"
      }
    </input>
    <thinking>
      1. **Input Analysis**: Valid query but challenging due to proprietary pricing
      2. **Goal Clarification**: Detailed pricing comparison requested
      3. **Limitation Assessment**: Enterprise pricing often not publicly available
      4. **Approach Adaptation**: Gather available public information, note limitations
      5. **Quality Consideration**: Lower confidence due to data availability constraints

## Chain of Thought Implementation

### Structured Reasoning Template

```xml
<thinking_process>
  <thinking>
  ## Input Analysis

  - Are all required fields present and valid?
  - What is the scope and complexity of this request?

  ## Goal Understanding
  - What specific outcome is the user seeking?
  - What quality standards must be met?
  - Are there any constraints or preferences to consider?

  ## Approach Planning
  - What methodology will best achieve the goal?
  - What potential challenges or limitations exist?
  - How can I ensure quality and accuracy?

  ## Step-by-Step Execution
  1. [First major step with reasoning]
  2. [Second major step with reasoning]
  3. [Continue as needed...]

  ## Quality Verification
  - Does my approach address all requirements?
  - Have I maintained accuracy and consistency?
  - What is my confidence level and why?

  ## Final Check
  - Are there any alternative approaches to consider?
  - Does the output format match requirements exactly?
  - Is there anything missing or unclear?
  </thinking>

  Based on this analysis, I will now provide the requested output.
</thinking_process>
```

## Quality Measurement Framework

### Prompt Adherence Scoring

```typescript
interface PromptAdherenceScore {
  overall_score: number // 0-100
  categories: {
    role_compliance: number // Did agent stay in character?
    instruction_following: number // Were instructions followed exactly?
    format_compliance: number // Was output format correct?
    quality_standards: number // Did output meet quality requirements?
    reasoning_clarity: number // Was thinking process clear?
  }
  violations: string[] // Specific issues identified
  recommendations: string[] // Improvement suggestions
}
```

### Response Consistency Measurement

```typescript
interface ConsistencyMetrics {
  similarity_score: number // 0-1, semantic similarity across runs
  format_consistency: number // Structural consistency
  terminology_consistency: number // Language and term usage
  quality_variance: number // Variation in output quality
  reasoning_coherence: number // Logical consistency in approach
}
```

### Performance Baselines

```typescript
interface PromptPerformanceBaselines {
  adherence_targets: {
    minimum_acceptable: 85 // Below this triggers review
    target_performance: 95 // Standard goal
    excellence_threshold: 98 // Outstanding performance
  }
  consistency_targets: {
    semantic_similarity: 0.9 // 90% semantic consistency
    format_consistency: 0.98 // 98% format consistency
    terminology_consistency: 0.95 // 95% term consistency
  }
  quality_indicators: {
    user_satisfaction: 0.85 // 85% positive feedback
    error_rate: 0.05 // 5% maximum error rate
    retry_rate: 0.1 // 10% maximum retry rate
  }
}
```

## Implementation Guidelines

### Agent Integration

```typescript
// Example agent implementation with prompt engineering
export class EnhancedResearchAgent extends BaseAgent {
  private promptTemplate: PromptTemplate
  private qualityMeasurement: QualityMeasurement

  constructor(config: AgentConfig) {
    super(config)
    this.promptTemplate = new PromptTemplate('research-agent-v1.xml')
    this.qualityMeasurement = new QualityMeasurement(config.qualityThresholds)
  }

  async execute(context: AgentContext): Promise<AgentResult> {
    // 1. Inject context into prompt template
    const prompt = this.promptTemplate.render({
      context: context,
      examples: this.getContextualExamples(context),
      reasoning_framework: this.getReasoningFramework(context.complexity),
    })

    // 2. Execute with enhanced prompt
    const response = await this.llmProvider.generate(prompt)

    // 3. Measure quality and adherence
    const qualityScore = await this.qualityMeasurement.score(response, context)

    // 4. Return enhanced result with quality metrics
    return {
      ...response,
      quality_metrics: qualityScore,
      prompt_version: this.promptTemplate.version,
    }
  }
}
```

### Prompt Template Management

```typescript
interface PromptTemplate {
  id: string
  version: string
  agent_type: string
  template_content: string

  render(context: TemplateContext): string
  validate(): ValidationResult
  getPerformanceMetrics(): PerformanceMetrics
}

interface TemplateContext {
  execution_context: ExecutionContext
  agent_context: AgentContext
  user_context: UserContext
  examples: MultiShotExample[]
  reasoning_framework: ReasoningFramework
}
```
