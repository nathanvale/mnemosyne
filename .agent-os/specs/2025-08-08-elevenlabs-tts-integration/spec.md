# ElevenLabs TTS Integration Spec

> Spec: ElevenLabs Text-to-Speech Provider Integration  
> Created: 2025-08-08  
> Status: Planning

## Overview

Integrate ElevenLabs Text-to-Speech API as a new provider option in the Claude hooks package, offering high-quality voice synthesis with support for 32 languages, multiple voice styles, streaming capabilities, and advanced voice customization. This integration will provide developers with access to state-of-the-art TTS technology for enhanced user interactions and accessibility features.

## User Stories

### High-Quality Voice Synthesis

As a **developer**, I want to use ElevenLabs' high-quality TTS voices so that I can provide natural-sounding speech output with emotional nuance and multi-language support for better user experience.

The integration provides:

- Access to ElevenLabs' premium voice models including eleven_multilingual_v2 and eleven_flash_v2
- Support for 32 languages with automatic language detection
- Multiple pre-built voices (alloy, echo, fable, onyx, nova, shimmer) and custom voice IDs
- Voice customization through stability, similarity boost, and style parameters

### Low-Latency Streaming

As a **developer building real-time applications**, I want streaming TTS capabilities so that I can provide immediate audio feedback with minimal latency for interactive experiences.

The system supports:

- Streaming audio generation with chunked responses
- Flash v2.5 model for ultra-low latency applications
- Progressive audio playback while generation continues
- Configurable chunk sizes and buffer management

### Flexible Audio Output

As a **developer with specific audio requirements**, I want multiple output format options so that I can optimize for quality, file size, or compatibility based on my application needs.

The integration enables:

- Multiple audio formats: MP3, Opus, PCM, AAC, FLAC, Î¼-law, A-law
- Configurable bitrates from 32kbps to 192kbps
- Sample rate options from 8kHz to 48kHz
- Format selection based on use case (telephony, high-quality, streaming)

### Seamless Provider Management

As a **developer using multiple TTS providers**, I want automatic fallback capabilities so that I can ensure continuous service availability even if one provider fails.

The system delivers:

- Automatic fallback to OpenAI or macOS providers on ElevenLabs failure
- Provider priority based on API key availability and capabilities
- Transparent provider switching with consistent API interface
- Error handling and retry logic with exponential backoff
