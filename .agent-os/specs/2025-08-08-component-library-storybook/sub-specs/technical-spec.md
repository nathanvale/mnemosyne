# Technical Specification

This is the technical specification for the spec detailed in @.agent-os/specs/2025-08-08-component-library-storybook/spec.md

> Created: 2025-08-08
> Version: 1.0.0

## Technical Requirements

**Component Library Architecture**:

- Core components in `packages/ui/src/` with TypeScript-first development and comprehensive interface definitions
- React 19 compatibility with latest features including React.JSX.Element return types and modern hooks
- Schema validation integration with @studio/schema providing real-time validation and comprehensive error handling
- Component composition patterns with reusable ValidatedInput, ArrayInput, and form building blocks

**Memory Form Component System**:

- MemoryForm component with comprehensive form state management, validation tracking, and submission handling
- ValidatedInput component with visual feedback states (error, success, neutral) and accessibility compliance
- ArrayInput component with dynamic item management, add/remove functionality, and keyboard interaction support
- ValidationDisplay component with structured error/warning presentation and visual hierarchy

**Storybook Integration Framework**:

- Storybook configuration in `.storybook/main.ts` with Next.js Vite integration and comprehensive addon support
- Interactive stories with user interaction testing using @storybook/test and automated assertions
- Component documentation with autodocs generation and comprehensive API documentation
- Accessibility testing integration with @storybook/addon-a11y for compliance validation and inclusive design

**Testing and Quality Assurance System**:

- Vitest integration with @testing-library/react for comprehensive component testing and user interaction simulation
- Storybook test integration with @storybook/addon-vitest for story-based testing and component behavior validation
- Mock integration with @studio/mocks for isolated component testing with controlled API responses
- Component behavior testing with user-event simulation and comprehensive DOM assertions

## Approach Options

**Component Validation Strategy** (Selected)

- **Schema-driven validation with real-time feedback and comprehensive error handling**
- Pros: Type-safe validation, reusable validation logic, comprehensive error handling, developer productivity
- Cons: Schema dependency, validation overhead, complex error state management
- **Rationale**: Form components require reliable validation with consistent error handling patterns

**Alternative: Manual validation logic**

- Pros: Simple implementation, no external dependencies, direct control
- Cons: Code duplication, inconsistent patterns, difficult maintenance, error-prone
- **Decision**: Schema-driven approach chosen for consistency and reliability

**Storybook Integration Approach** (Selected)

- **Comprehensive integration with interactive stories and automated testing**
- Pros: Interactive documentation, automated testing, accessibility validation, visual regression testing
- Cons: Configuration complexity, build overhead, learning curve
- **Rationale**: Component library requires comprehensive documentation and testing for developer adoption

**Alternative: Basic story documentation**

- Pros: Simple setup, minimal overhead, easy maintenance
- Cons: Limited testing capabilities, no interaction validation, poor developer experience
- **Decision**: Comprehensive integration chosen for production-ready component library

**Component Architecture Strategy** (Selected)

- **Composition-based architecture with reusable building blocks and flexible customization**
- Pros: Reusable components, consistent patterns, flexible composition, maintainable codebase
- Cons: Architecture complexity, abstraction overhead, learning curve for developers
- **Rationale**: Component library requires scalable architecture for long-term maintainability

## External Dependencies

**react** - React library for component development

- **Purpose**: Core React functionality for component development with modern hooks and JSX
- **Justification**: Component library requires React as fundamental UI framework

**@studio/schema** - Schema validation library

- **Purpose**: Real-time validation with comprehensive error handling and type safety
- **Justification**: Form components require reliable schema-driven validation for data integrity

**@studio/logger** - Logging system integration

- **Purpose**: Component logging and debugging support with development and production modes
- **Justification**: Components require logging capabilities for debugging and error tracking

**@studio/mocks** - Mock data and API responses

- **Purpose**: Isolated component testing with controlled data scenarios and API response simulation
- **Justification**: Component testing requires realistic mock data for comprehensive scenario coverage

**@storybook/nextjs-vite** - Storybook framework integration

- **Purpose**: Component documentation and interactive development with Next.js and Vite optimization
- **Justification**: Component library requires comprehensive documentation and development tooling

**@storybook/addon-a11y** - Accessibility testing integration

- **Purpose**: Automated accessibility validation and compliance testing for inclusive design
- **Justification**: Production components require accessibility compliance and validation

**@testing-library/react** - Component testing utilities

- **Purpose**: User-centric component testing with DOM queries and interaction simulation
- **Justification**: Components require comprehensive testing with realistic user interaction patterns

**@testing-library/user-event** - User interaction simulation

- **Purpose**: Realistic user interaction testing with keyboard, mouse, and focus events
- **Justification**: Component behavior testing requires accurate user interaction simulation
