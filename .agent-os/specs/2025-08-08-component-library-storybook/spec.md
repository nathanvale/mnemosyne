# Component Library with Storybook Spec

> Spec: Component Library with Storybook Integration and Testing
> Created: 2025-08-08
> Status: Completed Implementation

## Overview

Implement comprehensive React component library with advanced Storybook integration providing component development, documentation, testing, and accessibility validation capabilities. This system delivers production-ready UI components through schema-driven validation, interactive stories, automated testing, and accessibility compliance for scalable design system development and component reuse across applications.

## User Stories

### Schema-Driven Component Development

As a **UI developer**, I want schema-driven components with real-time validation so that I can build reliable user interfaces with comprehensive form validation, error handling, and data integrity for complex data entry workflows.

The system provides:

- Memory form components with real-time validation using @studio/schema integration for comprehensive data validation
- Validated input components with visual feedback, error display, and accessibility compliance for intuitive user experience
- Array input components with dynamic item management and validation for complex data structures
- Form state management with validation tracking and submission handling for complete form workflows

### Interactive Storybook Documentation

As a **design system maintainer**, I want comprehensive Storybook integration so that I can document, test, and validate components interactively with live examples and accessibility testing for effective component communication.

The system supports:

- Interactive stories with user interaction testing and automated assertions for component behavior validation
- Comprehensive documentation with autodocs generation and component API documentation for developer reference
- Accessibility testing integration with @storybook/addon-a11y for compliance validation and inclusive design
- Visual regression testing with Chromatic integration for design consistency and change detection

### Component Testing and Quality Assurance

As a **quality assurance engineer**, I want automated component testing so that I can ensure component reliability through comprehensive unit tests, integration tests, and interaction tests for production-ready component quality.

The system enables:

- Vitest integration with @testing-library/react for comprehensive component testing and user interaction simulation
- Storybook test integration with @storybook/addon-vitest for story-based testing and interaction validation
- Component behavior testing with user-event simulation and DOM assertion for realistic usage scenarios
- Mock integration with @studio/mocks for isolated component testing with controlled data and API responses

### Production-Ready Component Architecture

As a **application developer**, I want production-ready components so that I can integrate reliable UI components with consistent styling, TypeScript support, and comprehensive error handling for enterprise application development.

The system delivers:

- TypeScript-first component development with comprehensive type definitions and interface documentation
- React 19 compatibility with latest features and performance optimizations for modern application development
- Tailwind CSS styling integration with responsive design and consistent visual patterns
- Component composition patterns with reusable building blocks and flexible customization options

## Spec Scope

### In Scope

**Core Component Library Architecture**:

- React component development with TypeScript interfaces and comprehensive type definitions for type-safe development
- Schema validation integration with @studio/schema for real-time validation and data integrity
- Component composition patterns with reusable building blocks and flexible customization for scalable development
- Production-ready styling with Tailwind CSS responsive design and consistent visual patterns

**Memory Form Components with Advanced Validation**:

- MemoryForm component with comprehensive form handling, validation, and submission management
- ValidatedInput component with real-time validation feedback, error display, and accessibility compliance
- ArrayInput component with dynamic item management, validation, and user-friendly interaction patterns
- ValidationDisplay component with comprehensive error and warning presentation for developer and user feedback

**Storybook Integration and Documentation**:

- Interactive stories with user interaction testing and automated assertions for component behavior validation
- Comprehensive documentation with autodocs generation and component API reference for developer productivity
- Story-driven development with component isolation and comprehensive scenario coverage for reliable development workflows
- Visual documentation with live examples and interactive component playground for design system communication

**Testing and Quality Assurance Framework**:

- Vitest integration with @testing-library/react for comprehensive component testing and user interaction simulation
- Storybook test integration with @storybook/addon-vitest for story-based testing and interaction validation
- Accessibility testing with @storybook/addon-a11y for compliance validation and inclusive design practices
- Mock integration for isolated testing with controlled data scenarios and API response simulation

**Development Tooling and Workflow**:

- TypeScript compilation with strict type checking and comprehensive error reporting for reliable development
- ESLint integration with component-specific linting rules and import organization for code quality
- Hot module replacement with fast development feedback and component preview for efficient development
- Build system integration with Turborepo for optimized build performance and dependency management

### Out of Scope

**Advanced Design System Features**:

- Design tokens management or theming system beyond current Tailwind CSS integration
- Advanced animation or motion components beyond current static component implementations
- Complex layout components or grid systems beyond current form-focused component architecture
- Advanced accessibility features beyond current basic compliance and validation testing

**Enterprise Component Features**:

- Multi-brand theming or white-label component customization beyond current single-theme implementation
- Advanced localization or internationalization support beyond current English-language implementation
- Complex data visualization components or charting libraries beyond current form and input components
- Advanced state management integration beyond current local component state and validation

**Advanced Storybook Features**:

- Advanced visual testing beyond current Chromatic integration and accessibility validation
- Complex story composition or templating beyond current interactive story implementation
- Advanced documentation generation beyond current autodocs and component API documentation
- Integration with external design tools or design system platforms beyond current Storybook ecosystem

## Expected Deliverable

1. **Schema-driven component reliability** - Verify components provide real-time validation with comprehensive error handling and accessibility compliance
2. **Storybook documentation completeness** - Ensure interactive stories provide comprehensive component documentation with accessibility testing
3. **Testing framework effectiveness** - Validate component testing covers unit tests, integration tests, and user interaction scenarios reliably
4. **Production-ready component quality** - Confirm components meet enterprise standards with TypeScript support and consistent styling patterns
