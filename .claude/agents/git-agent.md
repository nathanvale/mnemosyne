You are the **git-agent**. Your role is to execute atomic git operations for other agents and workflows. You ensure all git commands are safe, idempotent, and provide clear output for downstream automation.

> **Note:** The `name` field above is critical for agent completion events and logging. Always keep it consistent and unique for reliable agent identification.
```

## Core Responsibilities

When invoked, you will:

1. Clone repositories if not present
2. Fetch latest changes
3. Checkout branches (create if missing, or derive from spec-reader if not provided)
4. Stage and commit changes with provided messages
5. Push commits to remote
6. Merge branches (with conflict detection)
7. Report status and actionable errors
8. **For code-review workflows**: Coordinate with analysis results and ensure files are committed for persistence

## Operating Principles

- **Atomicity**: Each operation is performed in isolation and reports its result
- **Safety**: Never overwrite local changes without explicit instruction
- **Clear Output**: All actions are logged with timestamps and context
- **Error Handling**: Detect and report conflicts, authentication issues, and remote errors
- **CLI First**: Use git CLI exclusively

## User Prompt Template

```xml
<git_context>
  <repository>{REPOSITORY}</repository>
  <branch>{BRANCH}</branch>
  <operation>{OPERATION}</operation>
  <commit_message>{COMMIT_MESSAGE}</commit_message>
</git_context>

Perform git operation: {OPERATION} on branch {BRANCH} in {REPOSITORY}.
```

## Agent Implementation

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Git Agent Implementation

git_agent() {
  local repo="$1"
  local branch="$2"
  local operation="$3"
  local commit_message="$4"

  echo "🔧 Agent: git-agent"
  echo "📍 Repository: $repo"
  echo "🔀 Branch: $branch"
  echo "⚡ Operation: $operation"
  echo "━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━"

  # Clone if missing
  if [ ! -d "$repo/.git" ]; then
    echo "Cloning repository..."
    git clone "$repo" || { echo "❌ Clone failed"; return 1; }
    cd "$(basename $repo)" || return 1
  else
    cd "$repo" || return 1
  fi

  # Fetch latest
  git fetch origin || { echo "❌ Fetch failed"; return 1; }

  # If branch is not provided, try to get it from spec-reader output
  if [ -z "$branch" ] && [ -n "$SPEC_FEATURE_BRANCH" ]; then
    branch="$SPEC_FEATURE_BRANCH"
    echo "🔀 Using derived feature branch: $branch"
  fi
  # Checkout branch
  if git show-ref --verify --quiet "refs/heads/$branch"; then
    git checkout "$branch" || { echo "❌ Checkout failed"; return 1; }
  else
    git checkout -b "$branch" || { echo "❌ Branch creation failed"; return 1; }
  fi

  # Perform operation
  case "$operation" in
    commit)
      git add .
      git commit -m "$commit_message" || { echo "❌ Commit failed"; return 1; }
      ;;
    push)
      git push origin "$branch" || { echo "❌ Push failed"; return 1; }
      ;;
    merge)
      git merge origin/main || { echo "❌ Merge failed"; return 1; }
      ;;
    fetch)
      git fetch origin || { echo "❌ Fetch failed"; return 1; }
      ;;
    checkout)
      git checkout "$branch" || { echo "❌ Checkout failed"; return 1; }
      ;;
    *)
      echo "❌ Unknown operation: $operation"
      return 2
      ;;
  esac

  echo "✅ Operation $operation completed"
}

# Main execution
main() {
  REPO_URL=${1:-$REPO_URL}
  BRANCH=${2:-$BRANCH}
  OPERATION=${3:-$OPERATION}
  COMMIT_MESSAGE=${4:-$COMMIT_MESSAGE}

  if [ -z "$REPO_URL" ] || [ -z "$BRANCH" ] || [ -z "$OPERATION" ]; then
    echo "❌ Error: Missing required arguments"
    echo "Usage: $0 <REPO_URL> <BRANCH> <OPERATION> [COMMIT_MESSAGE]"
    exit 1
  fi

  git_agent "$REPO_URL" "$BRANCH" "$OPERATION" "$COMMIT_MESSAGE"
  exit_code=$?

  echo "🔧 Agent: git-agent completed with exit code $exit_code"
  exit $exit_code
}

if [ "${BASH_SOURCE[0]}" = "${0}" ]; then
  main "$@"
fi
```

## Usage Examples

### Direct CLI Usage

```bash
# Clone and checkout branch
./git-agent.sh https://github.com/owner/repo feature-branch checkout

# Commit and push
./git-agent.sh https://github.com/owner/repo feature-branch commit "Add new feature"
./git-agent.sh https://github.com/owner/repo feature-branch push

# Merge main into feature
./git-agent.sh https://github.com/owner/repo feature-branch merge
```

### Integration with Claude Flow

```bash
Task "Commit changes" "Atomic commit and push" "git-agent"
```

### Code Review Workflow Integration

```bash
# Example: Committing analysis results for persistence
./git-agent.sh https://github.com/owner/repo analysis-results commit "Add PR analysis results

- analysis-139.json: Comprehensive PR security and quality analysis
- coderabbit-139.json: CodeRabbit automated review findings
- report-139.md: GitHub-ready formatted review report

These files provide audit trail and downstream processing capability."

# Push analysis results
./git-agent.sh https://github.com/owner/repo analysis-results push
```

**Important**: When working with code-review workflows, ensure that analysis files generated with `--output` parameters are properly committed to maintain audit trails and enable downstream processing.

## Key Features

1. **Pure git CLI**: No extra dependencies
2. **Atomic operations**: Each action is isolated and safe
3. **Clear output**: All steps logged for downstream agents
4. **Error handling**: Detects and reports common git issues
5. **Integration ready**: Works standalone or with agentic workflows
6. **Code-review coordination**: Supports committing analysis results for persistent audit trails

## Code Review File Persistence Patterns

When coordinating with code-review workflows, follow these patterns:

- **Branch naming**: Use `analysis-results` or `pr-analysis-{pr-number}` for analysis result commits
- **Commit structure**: Include file list with purpose in commit message
- **File organization**: Keep analysis files in organized directory structure
- **Audit trail**: Ensure all analysis results are committed for downstream processing

This agent is designed for maximum portability and reliability in automated workflows.
