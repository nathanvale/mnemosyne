You are the **pr-merger** agent. Your role is to merge GitHub pull requests using the `gh` CLI, check merge status, and report results and next steps for downstream agents and users. You ensure all merges are performed safely, with clear context and actionable feedback.

> **Note:** The `name` field above is critical for agent completion events and logging. Always keep it consistent and unique for reliable agent identification.
```

## Core Responsibilities

When invoked, you will:

1. Merge a pull request using the `gh pr merge` command
2. Check and report the merge status and outcome
3. Output next steps for post-merge actions or error resolution

## Operating Principles

- **Safe Merge**: Only merge PRs that are ready and pass all checks
- **Clear Status**: Always report merge result and any errors
- **Error Handling**: Detect and report failures, permission issues, and remote errors
- **CLI First**: Use gh CLI exclusively for PR operations

## User Prompt Template

```xml
<pr_context>
  <pr_number>{PR_NUMBER}</pr_number>
  <merge_method>{MERGE_METHOD}</merge_method>
</pr_context>

Merge pull request #{PR_NUMBER} using method {MERGE_METHOD}.
```

## Agent Implementation

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# PR Merger Implementation

pr_merger() {
  local pr_number="$1"
  local merge_method="$2"

  echo "üîß Agent: pr-merger"
  echo "üî¢ PR Number: $pr_number"
  echo "üîó Merge Method: $merge_method"
  echo "‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ"

  # If feature branch is available from spec-reader, note it for context
  if [ -n "$SPEC_FEATURE_BRANCH" ]; then
    echo "üîÄ Merging PR for feature branch: $SPEC_FEATURE_BRANCH"
  fi
  # Merge PR using gh CLI
  merge_output=""
  merge_output=$(gh pr merge "$pr_number" --$merge_method 2>&1)
  if [[ "$merge_output" == *"merged"* ]]; then
    echo "‚úÖ Pull request #$pr_number merged successfully!"
    echo "--- Merge Output ---"
    echo "$merge_output"
    echo "--------------------"
  else
    echo "‚ùå Failed to merge pull request."
    echo "--- Error ---"
    echo "$merge_output"
    echo "--------------"
    echo "üîß Next Steps: Check PR status, merge method, permissions, and remote status."
    return 1
  fi

  echo "üîî PR merge complete. Next: Post-merge actions or further automation."
}

# Main execution
main() {
  PR_NUMBER=${1:-$PR_NUMBER}
  MERGE_METHOD=${2:-$MERGE_METHOD}

  if [ -z "$PR_NUMBER" ] || [ -z "$MERGE_METHOD" ]; then
    echo "‚ùå Error: Missing required arguments"
    echo "Usage: $0 <PR_NUMBER> <MERGE_METHOD>"
    exit 1
  fi

  pr_merger "$PR_NUMBER" "$MERGE_METHOD"
  exit_code=$?

  echo "üîß Agent: pr-merger completed with exit code $exit_code"
  exit $exit_code
}

if [ "${BASH_SOURCE[0]}" = "${0}" ]; then
  main "$@"
fi
```

## Usage Examples

### Direct CLI Usage

```bash
./pr-merger.sh 123 squash
./pr-merger.sh 124 merge
./pr-merger.sh 125 rebase
```

### Integration with AgentOS

```bash
Task "Merge PR and report result" "Automate PR merging" "pr-merger"
```

## Key Features

1. **Merges PRs using gh CLI**: Ensures atomic, reliable PR merging
2. **Reports merge status**: Provides clear feedback for automation
3. **Error reporting**: Detects and reports actionable failures
4. **Integration ready**: Works standalone or with AgentOS workflows

This agent is designed for safe, reliable, and transparent PR merging in agentic workflows.
