## 🧠 Phase 2: Memory Extraction

**Status**: Next  
**Appetite**: Large (8-12 weeks)  
**Dependencies**: Phase 1 complete

### Vision

Transform stored messages into structured emotional memories using GPT processing, creating the foundation for relationship-aware AI interactions.

### Core Deliverables

#### Memory Processing Engine

- **GPT Integration** - Process message batches for emotional context extraction
- **Memory Schema** - Structured format for emotional metadata and relationships
- **Batch Processing** - Handle large message volumes efficiently
- **Error Recovery** - Graceful handling of GPT API failures and rate limits

#### Memory Validation System

- **Review Queue** - Interface for validating extracted memories
- **Memory Editor** - Tools for refining GPT-generated emotional context
- **Quality Metrics** - Scoring system for memory accuracy and relevance
- **Feedback Loop** - Improve extraction prompts based on human review

#### Relationship Context Engine

- **Person Detection** - Identify participants in message exchanges
- **Relationship Mapping** - Track emotional dynamics between people
- **Timeline Analysis** - Understand how relationships evolve over time
- **Context Tagging** - Label memories with emotional and situational metadata

### Technical Architecture

```
Messages → GPT Processor → Memory Entries → Validation Queue
    ↓           ↓               ↓              ↓
Batch API → Emotional → Structured → Human Review
Pipeline    Analysis    Metadata    Interface
```

### Package Extensions

- **@studio/memory** - GPT processing and memory extraction
- **@studio/validation** - Review queue and memory editing tools
- **@studio/relationships** - Person and relationship tracking

### Success Criteria

- Extract meaningful emotional context from 80%+ of message batches
- Achieve 90%+ human validation rate for extracted memories
- Process 10,000+ messages per hour with GPT integration
- Generate relationship timelines spanning years of history

## 🤖 Phase 3: Agent Serving (MCP Engine)

**Status**: Future  
**Appetite**: Large (10-14 weeks)  
**Dependencies**: Phase 2 complete

### Vision

Build MCP (Model Context Protocol) engine that serves relationship-scoped emotional memory to AI agents, enabling conversations that feel like they "know you."

### Core Deliverables

#### MCP Protocol Engine

- **Memory Query API** - Retrieve relevant memories based on conversation context
- **Relationship Scoping** - Filter memories by participant relationships
- **Relevance Ranking** - Order memories by emotional and temporal relevance
- **Context Injection** - Format memories for agent consumption

#### Agent Integration Layer

- **Claude Integration** - Native support for Claude Code and chat
- **GPT Integration** - OpenAI API compatibility layer
- **Custom Agents** - Extensible interface for future AI systems
- **Memory Tracking** - Log which memories influence agent responses

#### Production Infrastructure

- **API Gateway** - Rate limiting, authentication, monitoring
- **Memory Caching** - Fast retrieval for frequently accessed memories
- **Analytics** - Track memory usage patterns and effectiveness
- **Privacy Controls** - Granular access controls for sensitive memories

### Technical Architecture

```
Agent Request → MCP Engine → Memory Retrieval → Context Injection
      ↓            ↓             ↓               ↓
Relationship → Relevance → Emotional → Enhanced
   Scope       Ranking     Context    Response
```

### Package Extensions

- **@studio/mcp** - Model Context Protocol engine
- **@studio/agents** - Agent integration adapters
- **@studio/api** - Production API gateway
- **@studio/analytics** - Memory usage tracking

### Success Criteria

- Sub-100ms memory retrieval for agent requests
- 95%+ agent satisfaction with provided emotional context
- Support 1000+ concurrent agent conversations
- Demonstrate measurably "warmer" AI interactions
