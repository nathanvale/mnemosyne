# 🎯 Focus vs. Task Churn

> “We don’t track tasks. We shape work, do it, and mark it done.”

This guide explains what we mean by _creating space for focus — not task churn_ in Basecamp-style project management.

---

## 🧘‍♂️ Focus Means:

- One clear goal per cycle
- Team autonomy to solve the problem
- Protecting time for deep work
- Trusting outcomes, not micro-managing processes

---

## ❌ What Task Churn Looks Like:

- Endless checklists and subtasks
- Kanban boards with dozens of cards
- Micro-status updates (“still working on...”)
- Planning tasks instead of solving problems

---

## ✅ What Focus Looks Like:

- A single well-shaped pitch
- Clear appetite (e.g. “2 weeks to build this”)
- Devs solve and ship the whole slice
- Progress tracked by outcome, not busywork

---

## 🧠 Why This Matters for MVPs

Task churn kills creative momentum.

You need focus to:

- Extract meaning from data
- Build memory models
- Explore prompt engineering

---

Let the team flow. Let the product evolve. Focus on what’s _done_, not what’s _tracked_.
