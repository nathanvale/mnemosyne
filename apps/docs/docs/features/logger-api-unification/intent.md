# üéØ Intent: Logger API Unification

## üé® Purpose

_Why does this feature exist? What problem does it solve?_

The logger API unification addresses a fundamental developer experience problem in the Mnemosyne project: inconsistent logging interfaces across environments that create unnecessary complexity, confusion, and maintenance overhead.

Currently, developers must learn different APIs for Node.js vs browser logging, deal with unpredictable function signatures, and manually set up testing infrastructure. This fragmentation was discovered during our documentation review, where we found multiple API discrepancies that made it difficult to create coherent, accurate documentation.

This feature exists to provide a unified, consistent logging experience that works identically across all environments, reducing cognitive load and improving developer productivity across the entire Mnemosyne ecosystem.

## üöÄ Goals

_What success looks like when this feature is complete_

- [x] **Unified API Surface**: Single set of logging methods that work identically in Node.js and browser
- [x] **Predictable Signatures**: Clear `log.info(message, context?)` pattern instead of magic argument handling
- [x] **Environment Parity**: Advanced features like `withTag()` and `withContext()` available everywhere
- [x] **Testing Simplicity**: Built-in mock utilities eliminate manual test setup
- [x] **Documentation Clarity**: Single API reference instead of environment-specific guides
- [x] **Backward Compatibility**: Existing code continues working during migration period

## üéØ Scope

_What's included and what's not_

### ‚úÖ In Scope

- API signature standardization across environments
- Node.js implementation of browser-only features (`withTag`, `withContext`)
- Unified factory function with environment detection
- Built-in testing utilities and mock logger
- Backward compatibility layer with deprecation warnings
- Documentation updates reflecting unified API
- Migration guide for existing usage

### ‚ùå Out of Scope

- New logging levels or capabilities beyond current features
- Performance optimizations or architectural changes
- Browser-specific remote logging enhancements
- Complex migration tooling or automated refactoring
- Changes to underlying logging libraries (Pino, etc.)

## üì¶ Package Impact

_Which @studio packages are affected_

- **@studio/logger**: Core package requiring significant API changes
- **@studio/scripts**: Update to new unified API signatures
- **@studio/ui**: Migrate logger usage in components and demos
- **@studio/test-config**: Integration with new mock utilities
- **All consuming packages**: Gradual migration to new API patterns

## üîó Dependencies

_What must be completed before this feature can start_

- [x] Complete documentation review (identified current API inconsistencies)
- [x] Basecamp-style planning documents (intent, design, pitch)
- [x] GitHub issue creation with technical requirements
- [ ] Stakeholder alignment on API changes and migration approach

## üé® User Experience

_How users will interact with this feature_

### Developer Experience Journey

1. **Discovery**: Developers import from `@studio/logger` and get consistent API regardless of environment
2. **Learning**: Single set of documentation and examples work everywhere
3. **Implementation**: Same logging patterns work in Node.js scripts, browser components, and tests
4. **Testing**: Built-in mock utilities provide immediate test setup without configuration
5. **Maintenance**: Consistent API reduces context switching between environments

### Before vs After Experience

**Before (fragmented)**:

```typescript
// Different APIs for different environments
// Node.js: magic args, manual context
log.info('User login', { userId: '123' }, 'extra data')

// Browser: different factory, advanced features only here
const browserLogger = createLogger().withTag('Auth')

// Testing: manual mock setup required
vi.mock('@studio/logger', () => ({
  /* complex setup */
}))
```

**After (unified)**:

```typescript
// Same API everywhere
log.info('User login', { userId: '123', extraData: 'value' })

// Same advanced features everywhere
const logger = createLogger().withTag('Auth')

// Built-in testing utilities
const mockLogger = createMockLogger()
```

## üß™ Testing Strategy

_How we'll verify this feature works_

- **Unit Tests**: Each logger method works identically across environments
- **Integration Tests**: Cross-package usage with new unified API
- **Backward Compatibility Tests**: Existing code continues working with deprecation warnings
- **Documentation Tests**: All examples in docs work in both Node.js and browser
- **Mock Testing**: `createMockLogger()` utility provides complete test coverage

## üìà Success Metrics

_How we'll measure if this feature is successful_

- **API Consistency**: 100% feature parity between Node.js and browser loggers
- **Documentation Simplification**: Single API reference replaces environment-specific docs
- **Developer Adoption**: Teams consistently use unified API in new code
- **Testing Improvement**: Reduced test setup time with built-in mocks
- **Issue Reduction**: Fewer questions/issues about logging API differences
- **Migration Success**: Smooth transition with minimal breaking changes

## üåç Strategic Context

_How this fits into the larger Mnemosyne vision_

This unification supports several key Mnemosyne principles:

### **Developer Experience First**

- Reduces cognitive load by providing consistent APIs
- Eliminates environment-specific learning curves
