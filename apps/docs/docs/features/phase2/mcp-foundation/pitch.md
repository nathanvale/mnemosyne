# üé™ Pitch: MCP Foundation Layer

## üéØ Problem

**The Phase 3 Integration Gap**: Phase 2 extracts rich emotional intelligence from memories, but there's no structured way for AI agents to access this data. Phase 3 will need MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers to provide emotional context to Claude agents, but building that from scratch would require major rework and delay agent integration by months.

**Current State**: We have emotional memories with mood scores, relationship dynamics, and conversation context, but they're locked in database tables. AI agents can't access this emotional intelligence because there's no API layer designed for agent consumption.

**Why This Matters Now**: Phase 3 Claude integration is the whole point of Phase 2. Without a foundation layer that bridges emotional memory extraction to agent-ready context, Phase 2 becomes an isolated proof-of-concept instead of a stepping stone to AI-enhanced conversations.

## üçÉ Appetite

**Time Investment**: 2-3 weeks  
**Team Size**: Solo development  
**Complexity**: Medium - API design with future MCP evolution path

**Scope Philosophy**: If this takes longer than 3 weeks, we'll **reduce API sophistication** or **simplify context assembly**, not extend time. The core mission is proving that emotional intelligence can be structured for agent consumption while laying MCP foundation.

## üé® Solution

### Core Vision

**What We're Building**: An emotional intelligence API layer that transforms raw memory data into agent-ready context through mood tokenization, relational timeline construction, and emotional vocabulary extraction. The system provides immediate HTTP/TRPC access while creating the foundation for future MCP server implementation.

**User Experience**:

- Phase 3 developer calls `/api/agent-context/user123` ‚Üí Receives structured emotional context ready for Claude consumption
- Context includes current mood, emotional timeline, tone-consistent vocabulary, and relationship dynamics
- Agent uses context ‚Üí "I remember when you felt supported by your friend during that challenging work situation..."
- Result: AI conversations enhanced with authentic emotional intelligence and relationship understanding

**System Integration**: The MCP foundation layer connects Phase 2's memory extraction directly to Phase 3's agent integration, creating the missing bridge that enables emotional AI conversations.

### What It Looks Like

**Agent Context API**:

```bash
$ curl /api/agent-context/user123?conversationGoal=support
{
  "moodTokens": {
    "currentMood": "cautiously optimistic",
    "moodTrend": "improving",
    "moodDirection": "positive",
    "recentTags": ["supported", "reflective", "grateful"]
  },
  "timeline": {
    "keyMoments": [
      {
        "date": "2024-07-18",
        "event": "Friend provided emotional support during job uncertainty",
        "emotionalSignificance": 8.5,
        "moodDelta": +0.4
      }
    ]
  },
  "vocabulary": {
    "emotionalThemes": ["support", "growth", "connection"],
    "toneProfile": "thoughtful, appreciative, relationship-focused",
    "responseRecommendations": ["acknowledge growth", "reference support network"]
  }
}
```

**Context Assembly Flow**:

```typescript
// Agent Context Assembly
const context = await agentContextAssembler.assembleContext(
  participantId: 'user123',
  conversationGoal: 'support'
)

// Optimized for Agent Consumption
{
  moodContext: "User feeling cautiously optimistic after recent support",
  emotionalTimeline: "Recent positive shift through friend's encouragement",
  vocabularyGuidance: "Use appreciative, growth-focused language",
  relationshipContext: "Values close friendships, seeks understanding",
  conversationTone: "supportive, acknowledging, emotionally aware"
}
```

**MCP Foundation Architecture**:

```typescript
// Future MCP Server Evolution
interface MCPEmotionalIntelligence {
  resources: {
    'emotional-memory': EmotionalMemoryResource
    'mood-timeline': MoodTimelineResource
    'relationship-context': RelationshipContextResource
  }
  tools: {
    analyze_mood_context: MoodAnalysisTool
    build_emotional_timeline: TimelineBuilderTool
    extract_conversation_tone: ToneExtractionTool
  }
}
```

## üèóÔ∏è How It Works

### Technical Architecture

**Three-Layer Context Assembly**:

1. **Data Layer**: Access emotional memories, mood scores, and relationship data from @studio/memory
2. **Processing Layer**: Transform raw data into agent-ready tokens, timelines, and vocabularies
3. **API Layer**: Provide structured context through HTTP/TRPC endpoints with caching and optimization

**Mood Context Tokenization**:
