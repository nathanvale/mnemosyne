# üîå Intent: MCP Foundation Layer

## üé® Purpose

The MCP Foundation Layer creates the foundational infrastructure for Phase 3 AI agent integration by providing structured emotional intelligence APIs, mood context tokens, and relational timelines. This layer enables future MCP (Model Context Protocol) server implementation while being immediately useful for accessing emotional intelligence from memory data.

**Key Problem Solved**: Phase 3 will require a standardized way to provide emotional context to AI agents through MCP servers. Without this foundation, Phase 3 integration would require major rework to create agent-consumable emotional intelligence APIs from scratch.

**Who Benefits**:

- **Phase 3 Claude Integration**: Structured emotional intelligence ready for AI agent consumption
- **Future Agent Development**: Standardized APIs for accessing emotional context and relationship dynamics
- **MCP Server Evolution**: Foundation layer that can evolve into full MCP servers without breaking changes
- **External Integrations**: HTTP/TRPC endpoints enable external systems to access emotional intelligence

**Vision Alignment**: This foundation layer bridges Phase 2's emotional intelligence extraction with Phase 3's agent integration, creating the API infrastructure that enables AI agents to access rich emotional context and relationship understanding.
