# üé™ Pitch: Memory Schema Definition

## üéØ Problem

**The Structure Gap**: Emotional context and relationship dynamics are inherently complex, multidimensional, and deeply nuanced. Without standardized data structures, memory extraction produces inconsistent formats, validation becomes unreliable, and AI integration is impossible. Raw emotional intelligence cannot be stored, queried, or processed effectively without a coherent schema foundation.

**Current State**: We have message data and Claude's ability to analyze emotions, but no standardized way to structure the output. Without consistent schemas, every component of Phase 2 would need to implement its own data structures, leading to integration chaos and unreliable memory processing.

**Why This Matters Now**: The memory schema is the foundational contract that enables all Phase 2 components to work together. Memory processing, validation, and Phase 3 integration all depend on consistent, well-defined data structures that preserve emotional richness while enabling computational efficiency.

## üçÉ Appetite

**Time Investment**: 1-2 weeks  
**Team Size**: Solo development  
**Complexity**: Medium - requires psychological insight balanced with technical implementation

**Scope Philosophy**: If this takes longer than 2 weeks, we'll **simplify emotional dimensions** or **reduce validation complexity**, not extend time. The core mission is creating a robust schema foundation that enables Phase 2 development, not building a comprehensive psychological framework.

## üé® Solution

### Core Vision

**What We're Building**: A comprehensive TypeScript schema system that transforms abstract emotional concepts into concrete, queryable data structures. The schema preserves the richness of human emotional context while enabling efficient AI processing, validation workflows, and database storage.

**Developer Experience**:

- Import type-safe interfaces: `import { Memory, EmotionalContext } from '@studio/schema'`
- Runtime validation utilities: `validateMemory(memory)` with detailed error reporting
- Schema transformation functions: `transformMemoryForExport(memory)` for Phase 3 compatibility
- IDE integration: Full TypeScript intellisense and compile-time validation

**System Integration**: The schema serves as the central contract between memory processing (Claude output), domain-specific validation UI components (human review), and storage (database persistence), ensuring consistent data flow across all Phase 2 components.

### What It Looks Like

**Core Memory Structure**:

```typescript
interface Memory {
  id: string
  sourceMessageIds: string[]
  participants: Participant[]
  emotionalContext: EmotionalContext
  relationshipDynamics: RelationshipDynamics
  summary: string
  confidence: number // 1-10
  extractedAt: Date
  validationStatus: ValidationStatus
  qualityMetrics?: QualityMetrics
}
```

**Emotional Context Schema**:

```typescript
interface EmotionalContext {
  primaryMood: 'positive' | 'negative' | 'neutral' | 'mixed' | 'ambiguous'
  intensity: number // 1-10
  themes: EmotionalTheme[]
  emotionalMarkers: EmotionalMarker[]
  contextualEvents: ContextualEvent[]
  temporalPatterns: TemporalPattern[]
}
```

**Relationship Dynamics Schema**:

```typescript
interface RelationshipDynamics {
  overallDynamics: {
    closeness: number // 1-10
    tension: number // 1-10
    supportiveness: number // 1-10
  }
  communicationPatterns: CommunicationPattern[]
  interactionQuality: InteractionQuality
}
```

**Validation Framework**:

```typescript
interface ValidationStatus {
  status: 'pending' | 'approved' | 'rejected' | 'needs_refinement'
  validator?: string
  qualityScore?: number
  refinementSuggestions: RefinementSuggestion[]
}
```

## üèóÔ∏è How It Works

### Schema Architecture

- Runtime type guards for validation and error prevention
- Schema validation utilities with detailed error reporting
- Transformation functions for version compatibility and export

**Emotional Intelligence Structure**:

- Psychological accuracy in emotional context and relationship dynamics
- Computational efficiency optimized for AI processing and database storage
- Extensible design supporting future advanced emotional models
- Integration points for memory processing, validation, and Claude consumption

**Quality Assurance Framework**:

- Validation workflow schemas with quality metrics and refinement tracking
- Confidence scoring aligned with psychological assessment principles
- Human validation interfaces based on schema-defined quality dimensions
- Export pipeline ensuring Phase 3 compatibility

### Implementation Strategy

**Package Structure**:

```
@studio/schema/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ memory/          # Core memory interfaces
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ validation/      # Validation workflow types
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ processing/      # Processing pipeline types
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ utils/          # Type guards and validation utilities
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ index.ts        # Main exports
```

**Development Workflow**:

```typescript
// Memory processing uses schema
const memory: Memory = await extractMemoryFromMessages(messages)
const validation = validateMemory(memory)

// Validation system uses schema
const qualityAssessment: QualityAssessment = await validateMemory(memory)
const refinement: RefinementSuggestion = suggestImprovement(memory)

// Export pipeline uses schema
const exportMemory: ExportMemory = transformMemoryForExport(memory)
```
