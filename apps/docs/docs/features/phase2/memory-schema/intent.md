# 🧠 Intent: Memory Schema Definition

## 🎨 Purpose

The Memory Schema Definition establishes the foundational data structures for emotional intelligence storage and manipulation within the Mnemosyne system. This component solves the critical problem of structuring complex emotional context, relationship dynamics, and personal memories in a way that preserves meaning while enabling efficient AI processing and human validation.

**Key Problem Solved**: Emotional context and relationship dynamics are inherently complex, multifaceted, and nuanced. Without standardized data structures, memory extraction would produce inconsistent formats, validation would be unreliable, and Phase 3 integration would be impossible. The schema provides the structural foundation that enables all other Phase 2 components to work cohesively.

**Who Benefits**:

- **Memory Processing Engine**: Consistent output format for Claude-extracted memories
- **Validation System**: Standardized structure for quality assessment and refinement
- **Phase 3 Integration**: Predictable data format for AI agent context injection
- **Future Development**: Extensible schema supporting advanced emotional intelligence features

**Vision Alignment**: This schema transforms abstract emotional concepts into concrete, queryable data structures that preserve the richness of human relationships while enabling AI systems to understand and utilize emotional context effectively.

## 🚀 Goals

### 🎯 Primary Goal: Emotional Structure Foundation

- **Target**: Define comprehensive TypeScript interfaces for emotional context, relationship dynamics, and memory metadata
- **Approach**: Schema design based on psychological research and practical AI integration needs
- **Impact**: Enables consistent emotional intelligence storage and processing across all system components

### 🎯 Secondary Goal: Validation & Quality Framework

- **Target**: Create standardized quality metrics and validation structures for memory assessment
- **Approach**: Confidence scoring, quality dimensions, and refinement tracking schemas
- **Impact**: Supports human validation workflow and iterative quality improvement

### 🎯 Success Metric: Integration Readiness

- **Target**: Schema supports seamless integration between memory processing, validation, and Claude integration
- **Approach**: Type-safe interfaces with clear boundaries and transformation utilities
- **Impact**: Reduces integration complexity and enables reliable data flow between system components
