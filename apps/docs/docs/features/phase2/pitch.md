# üé™ Pitch: Memory Extraction System

## üéØ Problem

**The Emotional Intelligence Gap**: Raw message data contains years of rich emotional context, relationship dynamics, and personal history, but this emotional intelligence is completely locked away in unstructured text. Without a way to extract and understand this emotional context through psychologically meaningful patterns, AI systems remain cold, transactional, and unable to provide the warm, personal interactions that make conversations feel genuinely human.

**Current State**: Phase 1 gave us structured message data - timestamps, senders, content, and relationships. But the emotional story buried in these messages remains invisible to AI systems. A conversation about supporting a friend through a difficult time looks identical to discussing weekend plans from a data perspective. Traditional extraction methods miss the emotional salience that makes moments memorable.

**Why This Matters Now**: Phase 3 (Claude Integration) cannot create meaningful relationship-aware AI without access to structured emotional context that mirrors human memory formation. The gap between raw message data and AI-ready emotional intelligence is the critical blocker for creating AI agents that feel like they "know you" through shared memories and emotional continuity.

## üçÉ Appetite

**Time Investment**: 6-8 weeks  
**Team Size**: Solo development  
**Complexity**: Medium-High - requires AI integration, quality validation, and emotional context extraction

**Scope Philosophy**: If this takes longer than 8 weeks, we'll **reduce quality thresholds** or **limit batch sizes**, not extend time. The core mission is proving that emotional memory extraction works with Claude integration, not building a production-scale processing system.

## üé® Solution

### Enhanced Core Vision

**What We're Building**: A psychologically-aware emotional intelligence extraction system that uses delta-triggered analysis, mood scoring, and smart validation to transform message history into emotionally meaningful memories. The system focuses on emotional salience - extracting moments that humans naturally remember (mood repairs, positive spikes, sustained tenderness) - while using auto-confirmation to reduce validation burden and creating MCP agent context for Phase 3 integration.

**Enhanced User Experience**:

- Developers run `pnpm extract:memories --batch 200 --focus emotional-significance` to process emotionally salient message batches
- System analyzes mood patterns with contextual scoring and delta detection
- Smart validation auto-confirms high-confidence memories (>0.75) and flags borderline cases for review
- MCP layer provides mood tokens, relational timeline, and emotional vocabulary for agent integration
- High-quality memories with emotional intelligence are exported for Phase 3 agent consumption

**System Integration**: The enhanced extraction system creates @studio/memory, @studio/validation (with domain-specific UI), @studio/schema, and @studio/mcp (foundation layer) packages that integrate seamlessly with Phase 1's message foundation while providing comprehensive emotional intelligence for Phase 3's Claude integration.

### What It Looks Like

**Enhanced CLI Processing Interface**:

```bash
$ pnpm extract:memories --batch 200 --focus emotional-significance
[INFO] Analyzing 200 messages for emotional context and mood patterns...
[INFO] Mood scoring: 89 messages with contextual analysis, 23 deltas detected
[INFO] Delta triggers: 8 mood repairs, 4 positive spikes, 2 sustained tenderness
[INFO] Claude processing batch 1/3 (67 emotionally significant messages)
[INFO] Extracted 3 emotional memories with avg confidence 8.2, mood salience 7.8
[INFO] Auto-confirmed: 2 memories (>0.75 confidence), Review flagged: 1 memory
[INFO] Claude processing batch 2/3 (66 messages)
[INFO] Extracted 2 emotional memories with avg confidence 7.8, mood salience 8.1
[INFO] Auto-confirmed: 2 memories (>0.75 confidence)
[INFO] Processing complete: 5 memories extracted, 4 auto-confirmed, 1 for review
[INFO] MCP context: Generated mood tokens and relational timeline for agent integration
```

**Enhanced Validation Interface**:

```typescript
// Smart validation with auto-confirmation and mood context
<SmartMemoryValidation
  memory={extractedMemory}
  autoConfirmationResult={autoConfirmationResult}
  moodContext={moodContext}
  deltaContext={deltaContext}
  onValidate={handleValidation}
  onRefine={handleRefinement}
  onFeedback={handleUserFeedback}
/>
```

**Enhanced Memory Structure**:

```typescript
interface ExtractedMemory {
  id: string
  participants: ['user1', 'user2']
  emotionalContext: {
    primaryMood: 'supportive'
    intensity: 8
    moodScore: 0.7
    themes: ['emotional support', 'friendship', 'difficult situation']
    deltaTriggers: ['mood_repair', 'sustained_tenderness']
  }
  relationshipDynamics: {
    closeness: 9
    supportiveness: 10
    communicationStyle: 'caring and direct'
  }
  moodScore: {
    score: 0.7
    tone: 'supportive'
    emotionTags: ['empathy', 'care']
  }
  moodDelta: { delta: 0.4; deltaType: 'mood_repair'; significance: 8.2 }
  emotionalSalience: 8.8
  toneCluster: ['supportive', 'empathetic', 'caring']
  summary: 'Deep conversation about supporting friend through job loss with mood repair'
  confidence: 8.5
  confidenceFactors: { emotionalSalience: 8.8; moodCertainty: 8.2 }
}
```

**MCP Agent Context**:

```typescript
interface AgentContext {
  moodContext: {
    currentMood: 'supportive'
    moodTrend: 0.4
    moodDirection: 'improving'
    recentMoodTags: ['empathy', 'care', 'support']
  }
  relationalTimeline: [
    {
      type: 'support'
      date: '2024-11-07'
      summary: 'Friend support during job loss'
    },
  ]
  emotionalVocabulary: ['supportive', 'empathetic', 'caring', 'understanding']
}
```

- Reduce target from 50-100 memories to 25-50 high-quality examples
- Simplify validation interface to basic approval/rejection
- Focus on single conversation type (e.g., support conversations)
