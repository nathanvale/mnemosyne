Thank you for your compliments - I was equally drawn to you too - your honesty and sincerity and I did notice I had to look away from your eyes to stop myself drowning in them.  I’d really like to see you again. Mel x ",,

Kissing you and wrapping my arms around you was totally worth it for the melting makeup moment.  I think a bit of chemistry, some things in common and an alignment of values are a great foundation for something worth pursuing. Really looking forward to seeing you again. Let me have a think about some ideas for our next rendezvous, I’ll get back to you and we can plan something together.

It’s been a jam packed day today. Levi and I have  just got back from a lovely family celebration out at Warrandyte and now we are just winding down. 

Hope you are having a great weekend! Chat soon… xx",,
Melanie,2023-10-22 10:57:08,,2023-10-22 11:06:26,,iMessage,Incoming,+61412667520,Melanie,Read,,,Thanks for your text - it made me smile.😊 I agree on what you said about why we are worth pursuing- would also add ( for me) there is a feeling of familiarity like I already kind of know you - always a good sign. Glad you and Levi had a good day yesterday. I’m looking forward to hugging you again xx,,
Melanie,2023-10-22 19:17:47,,,,iMessage,Outgoing,,,Read,,,"Hey me too! From the moment I laid eyes on you to when we started chatting it was like we have met before for sure - for a first date that was most welcome. I’m surprised we haven’t met before given that we have a shared adolescence on Sydney’s north shore and the last decade in this area! But we have now - finally! 🎉

So just briefly and in the spirit of being pragmatic I thought I would let you know that despite being a sole parent to a smaller child, it certainly is possible for me to make time to get to know you. I do have great support with our nanny, Jan, who is happy to babysit at night. Levi is also at the age now where he is comfortable to have sleepovers at is nannas in South Caulfied. He also from time to time spends a weekend at his Poppy’s in Warrandyte. My flexibility is pretty good - I just need to plan things. 

Speaking of planning things! Ive been thinking of how we could spend some more time together? Perhaps I could pick you up and we could drive down to St Kilda and have dinner at Cicciolina or Cafe Di Stasio. I do love Italian dining and I know they have plenty of great vegetarian/fish options. Of course I would love to hear your thoughts and on a date, or dates, that suit you?

It was another busy day today. Levi had a 7th birthday party. I’m sure you are all too familiar with that time in your life, when you attended lots of kids birthday parties and socialised with all the Sholem parents. It is a lovely little community and comforting to be a part of it. It was an under water themed party so I dressed the little guy in the cutest lobster costume. That’s him all sorted for Halloween and Purim now lol. 🦞 	

How was your weekend Mel? Did you do anything with the kids? I bet your dogs received lots of attention. ☺️",,
Melanie,2023-10-22 21:08:54,,2023-10-23 04:50:00,,iMessage,Incoming,+61412667520,Melanie,Read,,,"Hi Nathan - do your friends call you Nath? - thanks for your reassurance around being able to make time - all good - kids always come first whether they are 7 or 16😊 !
Yes I remember fondly our Sholem days and the busyness of kid’s parties and the warm community ... Levi’s outfit sounds v cute. 

…my weekends are a lot quieter now with older kids - sometimes too quiet I have to say . This weekend  I looked at a few places for sale, took Zach driving ( he has his L’s) Abi came over for dinner , cooked a new  recipe. Usually I catch up with an old Sholem friend for a walk but not this time.  Yes lots of dog walks and listening to music. 

So .. I should tell you I’m really low maintenance re dates -  😉I’m ok to go out to eat at night but can equally see a movie or breakfast/ brunch / walk.  ( I’m guessing though day time on the weekends harder for you)Saturday night is a good time as sometimes Zach will stay over at Abi . He is always out at gym sat and sun afternoons.  But I can go out anytime really - the only limiting factor is to get home and chase him off his computer games eventually!

Ok , hope that all helps plan something.

Melanie,2023-10-23 10:58:07,,,,iMessage,Outgoing,,,Read,,,"Morning Mel,

Ok well we are going to have to do something about those “sometimes too quiet” weekends. Mine aren’t always busy and quite often find myself craving some adult company to be honest. During the day isn’t always necessary harder for me. With some forward planning I can organise things for Levi to do without me being involved. Perhaps a Saturday evening dinner and movie could work. A Sunday afternoon matinee is always nice. Jewish film festival started today and runs for a couple of weeks. Love brunches and of course dog walks or feel free to drag me along to one of your property inspections if you like lol - love looking at real estate. Thanks for sharing your dating preferences with me - love your easy going nature. Whatever we end up doing I’m sure will enjoy each other’s company. Looking forward to it…

Im actually not working at the moment - in between contacts. Im waiting for a contract to sign with Origin Energy with a start date in the next week or so. (Actually Im around this week during the day, if you find yourself free between clients.)It is so nice having some time off work. Ive got some time now to get on top of some things.Sometimes I get called Nath. It’s not one of those names that are easy to truncate. But you can call me whatever you like. I don’t mind 😉Hope you have a good week! x",,

I would love to have your opinion on places I see - it’s pretty lonely doing it alone. 
This week is quieter for me too as I can’t remember if I told you, I got a new job that starts next week.  I needed more secure work and more hours now that I am single. On Monday s and Thursdays I will be working at a practice in Fitzroy and then Wednesday and Friday is my own clinic in Brighton east . So I have just consolidated all my clients onto only weds and Fridays to make the new job work . 
Tuesdays are my admin day so very flexible as it’s just writing reports, invoicing etc . 
So I could easily catch up with you tomorrow  any time after school drop off until 2.30 if that worked for you ?

No worries. Yeah I think you are right perhaps text tone is more of an interpretation of the reader - it takes some degree of vulnerability to write in a direct and honest way so I appreciate the positive review. Glad you haven’t interpreted my writing style as being brash!  But yeah It’s all part of trying to get to know you and make a connection with you - I’ve really enjoyed your thoughtful responses too.

Sounds like your weekdays are going to keep you busy moving forward. That’s great, busy is good. But before then I am free tomorrow as well. Would you like to do brunch? Do you have a favourite place you like to go?

Melanie,2023-10-25 20:30:47,2023-10-25 20:30:48,,,iMessage,Outgoing,,,Read,,,"Hi Mel, Haha I’m loving seeing your sense of humour seep through. You made me giggle. 🤭 I don’t know… I wouldn’t mind dating myself. That guy is a catch! Haha 😉 I’m sure we still would have liked our chubby versions. Hey my eyes still would have been the same! I haven’t had anyone comment on them in years so it’s lovely to once again receive that compliment. In fact words of affirmation may be the love language which resonates with me the most. I wonder if our love languages are similar too. 😉 In all seriousness I’m loving the common ground we have discovered however with all things in life there is always nuance, so I’m looking forward to seeing how we differ. Myers Briggs began creating their personality indicator during World War II so it’s a bit old and outdated. You probably have heard of the more modern Big Five personality test, also known as the OCEAN personality test, it is based on the Big Five model that defines human personality as the combination of 5 personality traits – Openness, Conscientiousness, Agreeableness, Extraversion and Neuroticism. Perhaps for fun we could do this test together some time and see where we land. ☺️

I just wanted to acknowledge that I really appreciated you sharing your recent personal health history with me. I know that it was coming from a place of consideration to how that might make me feel. And I’m guessing having that on your mind may have contributed to your second date nerves. So thank you! Your empathy is another feature of yours that I find very attractive. Like I said I wasn’t shocked or triggered. I actually found your story beautiful - in the spiritual sense. The universe sure has awakened you. I am happy for you - you are on a new path now.

Good news. I finally received word today that my start date for the next tech engagement is November 8th - so it looks like I’m on holiday for another 2 weeks. Hmmmm now I am going to have to think about what to do with myself 😎 xx",,

Well just so happens your favourite date ( based on your previous comment that you are a good catch therefore by extension since we are practically the same person ( joking) I must also be a good catch ) is also an unemployed bludger for a bit . 😉( just looked at new job diary and no clients booked yet - will take a while to build up I’m guessing) . So just let me know when is a good time to catch up  so I can compliment your eyes again. 

So it’s not a surprise that words of affirmation is my LL too . Hence why I’m reduced to a melted puddle on the floor after reading your words …. You really are a skilful and romantic writer. The best  I’ve seen  without being smutty .  I would also add quality time and touch.   

I’d love to do the big 5 with you - and yes I’m sure we have some differences too . For starters I can tell you now I’m probably more neurotic than you and I’m very conscientious.  Maybe we could also go through the “ 36 questions to fall in love to “ have you heard of these?  I’m not suggesting we should necessarily have any expectations about falling in love ( although that’s a distinct possibility… do you like how I’m amping up my flirting here ?😉)but it just looks like a fun way to get to know each other . 

Yes I knew I needed to tell you about the cancer so you could make a decision to give me the flick if need be - i truely thought it was a deal breaker -I was so nervous to tell you and even rehearsed it in my head before I saw you . I truely believe the universe gifted me a second chance to live after 14 years of living a kinda half life . I feel so lucky and awakened . 

Congrats on the new work you just got xx ",,

But also loving our romantic writing! it’s been very engaging and flirtatious. And all the compliments… 🥰 Thank you 🙏🏻 

Great! Sounds like there is some potential for us to become partners in crime over the next couple of weeks with some more free time to share. It’s been a big day today but let me get back to you in the morning and I’ll write to you some more. xx",,
Melanie,2023-10-27 09:08:55,,,,iMessage,Outgoing,,,Read,,,"Morning Mel,

Great! Yes we should do the big 5 together - especially seeing that we have some time on our hands at present. I haven’t done one before and have always wanted to - even though I signed up a year ago and never got around to doing it 😬. So… I have purchased an assessment voucher for you too so you can join in the fun whenever you like. ☺️

https://www.understandmyself.com/Voucher/Redeem/-XwJ3LyiOUqA1k_jldii0g

I think with this test we can link each others final assessments and get access to a relationship report that will include the assessment scores/results for both of us and a description of what you might expect from being in a romantic relationship with one another - it would be fun to see that! The site is run by well known Canadian clinical psychologist Dr Jordon Peterson so looking forward to seeing what we get out of it.

After a busy week my calendar is now very free from today onwards up until after Melbourne cup day. Looks like a quiet weekend too so could easily find some time to make plans with you if you are around. Im really looking forward to this time off now. Ive already seen two great films at the classic this week and I know there is plenty more on at the moment. I can also see long walks with my fluffy friend along the beach - or perhaps with you too my not so fluffy friend? And then not so fun stuff but satisfying upon completion such as getting on top of life stuff.

Okay off again to the gym now. Happy Friday! xx",,

It’s a smart way to get to know each other - I think if these explorations become physically intimate before working out the other persons character, values, relationship goals there is a risk ( from all the hormones circulating!) that one can think the person is a good match when it’s only based on an overpowering biology/ hormones. … that doesn’t mean I haven’t wondered what it would be like to kiss you …

Ok so I was thinking…what are your thoughts on coming around to mine around 5pm for some happy hour chats - non alcoholic drinks and then we could go next door and see a 6pm movie. There are two on at that time that could be good:

OR perhaps come around a bit later say 6:30pm for chats and then enjoy a night of jazz at South Side at 8:00pm (also next door to mine)

https://www.classiccinemas.com.au/movies/john-scurrys-reverse-swing-quintet

I do drink small amounts of alcohol if other people are drinking - I’m not that fixed in my views for occasional alcohol - but not fussed either way ... alcohol can make me a bit funnier so there are benefits 😊 
Let’s do 5 pm at yours and then a movie - if you are ok with that too? ( that earlier time works well as Zach having dinner with Paul at 6 ) 
I loved Past Lives and could happily see it again and funnily enough a friend booked me a ticket to matchmaking for next weekend- so well picked by you .. do you have a preference?

So… I read your beautiful collection of doggy musings to get closer to you. And it certainly is all you! Your intelligence, creativity, empathy and sense of humour - I had a few giggles. What a great body of work.  And the collaboration with Nat… her illustrative style perfectly matches the tone of the writing. So many thumbs up! 👍🏻 

A couple of my favourite lines that resonated with me.

'Love helps you find your way home, even if home is across a freeway,' Alfie noted.

'Be present in the now, accept your imperfections. We are all crossbreeds after all,' noted Alfie. (Haha)

Aside Muffin received lots of attention today instead. We cruised around together to Caulfied park -with sun roof open enjoying the good life 😎 🐶 . I let her gnaw on the left over lamb shoulder bone and then gave her a big soapy bath.

Sounds like muffin had a doggy dream day - lamb and a bubble bath - it doesn’t get better than that ! 

I just realised now you know my full identity - surname and all!  Let’s hope when you google me you don’t find the article on me about that time I stalked a guy I met on an online dating app lol 😂 

Would love to see you again soon special human friend . Today, Tuesday or Thursday (although Thursday could potentially end up with clients) are best days -  we could take the dogs to the beach - I’m sure Gibson would love a play date with Muffin 😊

Although some call me  Mr. Vale, you're welcome to call me whatever you'd like. 😉 I’m not interested one bit in your digital footprint. I’ve looked deep into your eyes and that’s all I need to see. 🥰 And if stalking is your thing… I guess I could live with that haha. 😉

Besides my LinkedIn profile, I haven’t been active on socials in over 10 years - Facebook maybe 5. In my mid 30s I had a stint at being a professional photographer. I shot dozens of families and weddings around that time - leading up to my separation. I used socials for a bit of marketing and posted a bit of photography to my Flickr/Insta account.  Back then being active in social media was generally quite a fun and innocent thing to do. However for me over the years I’ve become quite concerned about the reach “Big Tech” has had into our privacy and psyche, so I’ve steered clear. But google away, I don’t mind,  a lot of my past creativity is up there. I must confess, the thought of seeing you today, knowing you're available, is incredibly tempting. My heart say a big yes but my body and mind says no. So sorry heart you are out numbered two to one. Having a self care / rest day from being overly active recently. I’ve had an another very leisurely ride along the bay this morning and this afternoon I think I’ll hit the St Kilda sea bath steam room. Perhaps a doggy beach date tomorrow could work for us?Wow the idea of someone doing something for me sounds amazing! Thank you! 🙏🏻 And you know what? It seems that all the stars are aligned for us and your generous act of kindness.

I hope your steam room outing brought more relaxation- I had an infrared sauna yesterday and the effects are amazing - drifted into a deep sleep

 On a sadder note Alfie woke up dragging his leg this morning and can no longer walk  comfortably- he is 16 - and it’s time now - I’m pleased he made it clear to me today that he has to go . He came into our lives when Paul and I were in crisis 14 years ago and provided comfort and wisdom for all that time and now that we have split - he sees we are ok and his work here is done…lots of tears today but we have planned a celebration of his life tomorrow night including fresh chicken livers and a cake that Abi will make for him. I’m going to go to office works and frame some pictures of him too . We will say our final goodbyes on Wednesday 😢

Thinking lots of lovely thoughts about you though and that helps xx",,

To truly live, of which Alfie did,  is also to recognise the shadow that accompanies the light - death.  It reminds us of the transience of our existence and underscores the value of every moment we are granted. Perhaps this isn’t an end but a transition? Glad to see you are embracing this special moment - and as a family. Very sad indeed - sorry to hear Melanie.😔

Thanks heaps for your understanding - that is very cool of you 😎.  The St Kilda baths were closed for the week due to maintenance so I guess that wasn’t meant to be. Instead I headed to my naturopath and refilled my behind the counter prescription for magnesium bisglycinate. Oo yeah that’s the good stuff for a healthy stress response. I  should be felling much better in no time ☺️My local gym has an infrared sauna and I tried it last week - perhaps I should make that a regular thing. It was great. Im looking forward to getting back into my deep sleeps again too.

I am still very much on the Nathan and Melanie love express train though! Next stop dog walk tomorrow morning? (or whatever suits the mood you wake up in) Perhaps a big hug will ease your sadness? Though I guess it is something to be embraced at this time.Great 2pm… in my calendar for our special date. Lots of hugs and xxx Mr Vale.",,

There once was a parent who shivered and shook, 
She glared at the menace whose son it had took, 
She asked all the others” aren’t you afraid?” 
They buried their heads and said no, naught, nay. 
She galloped ahead on her horse of concern, 
The others, it seemed had nothing to learn, 
They thought her reaction was that of a witch, 
Much too extreme, we’ll stay in our ditch. 
But the menace was bigger than she could cope, 
So confused that the others together, myope. 
So alone in this sure-sighted pain she sat, 
Wishing a larger force could wrap- 
Her up in blanket, broomstick her away, 
To a place where the answer was always “its OK” 
Her son almost swallowed by the World Wide Web, 
And no one can save him or get into his head. 
This menace the internet too big a force, 
Too big for mum to make safe alone, of course. 
Yet who can keep him from this vortex of risk, 
Too young to remember the floppy disc- 
When days were simple and online smut 
was never a worry in my more well -toned gut. 
There once was a parent who shivered and shook, 
Her son growing up throws her a look- 
Trust me online, I’m safe, he exclaimed, 
As my influence over him wains and wains.",,

Here is your daily prose and song : 

Dear Zachy,
I know you prefer Zach now….that’s ok.  Can you believe me made it here? This land of Instagram and Snapchat where spoken words are scant.  I miss you so much and I want to feel excited to show you around this new land we now find ourselves in. But I’m just scared. I know I’m supposed to be the Bigger, Kinder, Wiser One but its hard to muster all this. I’ll try be the best tourguide I can. 

Hey little guy, come over here. Look what’s on the menu now- you love chilli and spice in your chicken- oats are still on the menu too. Remember I would carry you from your bed to the kitchen bench. Now you sit here on a stool, with your hoodie covering your face and eyes looking away. You are still very funny - in fleeting moments we laugh instantly at the same thing- the sound that a word makes in a well-timed word vomit or the quirky humour that still only you and I laugh at while the rest of the family look on, bemused. We still have something special- we always will. Its just more scant, more distant now.  Don’t be sad little guy- you are supposed to move away, become your self, find comfort with friends. 

Do you see the marks on the ceiling? Remember the ball I let you play with indoors created these stains. But I knew you needed to move and toss and play to feel good so I let you. We can paint over the childhood marks, we can tidy the endless toys and create a neater place, The neatness looks lonely and barren, I know.   I never knew I would pine for mess. 
Come see your sister- oh she is out with her friends- maybe she will be home soon. You used to love playing schools, she the teacher, you the little boy- so cheeky yet compliant for her, finishing pages and pages of made up schoolwork for her to mark. The closeness between you was delicious.  

Yes, its different here now. Its neat and painted over and less chaotic. It’s quiet with too much space and time. The space and time is confronting- I’m left to look inwards but that is not your pain to hold. What you hold now is the energy to move onwards, grow up, fulfill your potential. Stay here little guy- do you see who you have become?! Do you feel as proud as I do? Love you.

Oh how I would pine for their gleeful laughter, the sweet cacophony of their animated stories and the tender touch of their tiny hands. We cherished joys, embarked on our adventures, imaginary and concrete, and at the end of the day cuddled up with a bedtime story. But now those tiny hands that once reached out for mine have embarked on their own journeys. The void now left by their growing up so profound, a silent ache that lingers.

To thank you, here is a little poem I wrote for you about this guy who had a very memorable first date. xxx

I landed at ten to two, the parking fairy, in kindness due,
Within my vehicle, a bundle of frets, yet by the stroke of two, I set,
Across the road, she caught my view, a thought escaped, 'She's cute, it's true.'
I crossed with care, my heart en route, to share a smile, my warm salute.
Our souls entwined in swift rapport, we connected as if through an open door.
In the shade of elms, away from the stark, we wandered the paths of Caulfield park,
Her eyes alight, she leaned in close, my life's work to her an engrossing prose,
In spiritual tones, our conversation soared, how much you can love, delightfully explored,
Ill-suited shoes for our parkland quest, twice she stumbled, my reflex to the test,
Beneath the cool of a leafy glade, to a welcoming table our path I made,
Sat down, our souls laid bare, our stories mingling in the sunlit air,
Until she paused, a faltering phrase, yet in her eyes, I found my gaze,
I broached the art of cuisine's array, to which she shared her herbivore's way,
Her vegetarian ways she kept veiled, a story untold, a path untrailed,
With a promise, a mystery's stay, we'd unfold her herbivore's tale another day,
I glanced at the clock, time had flown in stealth, walked her back, cherishing our accumulated wealth,
In parting's embrace, 'neath the fervent sun's race, her makeup did grace, my soft cheek's space,
Yet as she wiped away the colorful smear, no care had I, for her closeness was dear,
We parted with promises to meet once more, in mutual accord, a next encounter… for sure!",,

“The Mystery Date stands out as the must-see romantic comedy of the year. Nathan and Melanie radiated a delightful warmth and sincerity that leaped off the screen, especially during the charming driving scenes.  How impossible not to burst into laughter as they found themselves in the midst of a school band jazz club, attended by only the friends and families of the talented performers. With incredible courage, they openly displayed their affection amidst a sea of unfamiliar faces.  The storyline gracefully unfolded, leading to a brilliantly satisfying conclusion.  What's more, the lead actress delivered not one but two climactic performances. Credit to her leading man for providing unwavering support. As the credits rolled, I found myself moved to tears, having witnessed the palpable closeness between them, the hushed conversations, and the unspoken connections that lingered in the air. A truly five-star experience! “ ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️",,

I found another review in todays Age : 

Such a magnificent movie, The Mystery Date, that after watching it viewers are moved to wonder with great curiosity about this deep connection developing between Nathan and Melanie. The standout scene had to be where they melted into each other oblivious to the photo-snapping-nannas at the high school assembly playing out around them…. funny and gentle and possibly the sweetest part of the whole movie. 
Nathan was a standout throughout this evening of perfection with his attentive gaze, magical touch and undefinable energy that just intoxicated the leading lady . Although this movie was 9 hours long, the viewer becomes unaware of time and space and is simply present with what is unfolding.  This movie is sure to attract accolades of acknowledgment given its return to old world romanticism and the potential for ongoing sequels where viewers will be able to delight in the joy that Nathan brings to Melanie and the unspoken possibilities.  I loved The Mystery Date - it was comfortable like an old friend yet thrilling like a new lover.  10 stars from me. ⭐️ ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️",,

They instead commented “Despite being the outliers in the dimly lit jazz club, their connection was so powerful that they remained blissfully unaware of the shared space, hopelessly lost in their deep affection for each other.”
I found today’s Age review much more on point though, and in tune with the comedic undertones of the film - haha “photo snapping nannas.”  I also agree that it is refreshing to see films of this genre finally return to old world romanticism. I eagerly await the possibility of sequels to come..

So… dropping back things back to a more pedestrian style of texting for a wee bit… Thanks again for Saturday. Our playful writing yesterday pretty much summed up my gratitude and affection for our mystery date - I meant every word of it. 🙏🏻 The rest of my weekend was also eventful, with not one but two birthday parties for Adam (Levis uncle)-it seems a benefit of being a child of separated parents with new families is two birthday cakes to blow out candles! 🥳 I was well spent by the end of the day though, you know with the drive out to Warrandyte and all those lovely family conversations across the day. By the end of it all the little old introverted me welcomed an opportunity to have a rare night to myself - I left Levi at Marilyns. Some couch time with Muffin, an engaging period drama on AppleTV, Life lessons with Brie Larson, and an early night was just what was needed. Things are about to change course with only a couple of days left of unemployment, then back to work for me. And then yeah I’m also flying in and out of Sydney this weekend for a catchup with Andrew.  My recruiter just texted then and we are now on for a pub lunch today to celebrate landing this new tech engagement - unbelievable that we have been networking for 8 years and this time has finally come to fruition for us 🎉. Haha I just dragged myself in and out of the gym, Oh gosh it’s a busy time - for how much I  would love to just be with you, so we can slow down time together and nurture with love and care this lovely thing going on between us 🌱 Perhaps we can find a way tomorrow? xxx

Thank you again for your movie reviews and the confirmation that you meant every word ❤️. I did too and I received every word of yours with pure joy. ….

..you have had a busy few days - I totally get the need for downtime - I am very similar if I am around people for extended periods of time. Despite feeling really tired yesterday, I really enjoyed Matchmaking at the classic yesterday with my friend Lianne, and the community of Jewish people in the cinema all coming together to enjoy the same- it’s a funny feeling even though I’m not religious I sometimes feel I’m with extended family when in a group of Jews.- a feeling of comfort when this sea of faces just look familiar in some way - a soothing balm for someone like me with oodles of existential anxiety . 🤣

 I must say I’m so grateful that our schedules have been less busy just as we met each other giving us some time to get to know each other - things are going to get busier for both of us  but I know we will make time to nurture this sweet beginning.  

Risking vulnerability, which I feel I can do with you , I did have a thought that I will miss you while you are away next weekend - and it also scared me a little that I even had that thought at all- the fear of closeness because of the potential hurt that can come with that - I know you understand this. 

This is beautiful and it’s also uncertain and new and fragile - but I’m here for the ride cause what is living a full life without taking the risk? 

On a lighter note just had the pleasure of giving Zach and his mate a lift to basketball- listening to their funny teenage banter in the back seat is a joy - they are so funny and I love seeing Zach in a different light with a friend - honoured to drive them.  

Would love to see you tomorrow- I have a walk with with of my animal assisted therapy colleagues at 9 am and I think I have my psychologist at 3 pm ( unless i got it wrong cause it’s a public holiday)  but free any other time . 

Hope your lunch celebration goes well .
Mel xxx. 😘",,

I’ve also never come eye to eye and perhaps heart to heart with another man who is kindred enough to hold my sensitivity without fear  and more importantly with complete understanding of it, and perhaps allow me to nurture his sensitivity too … ( that might be why I’ve never enjoyed kissing at all until I met you) 
I’ve always had to hide it ( sensitivity)from people- family, partners etc most people shun it in themselves even.  I used to have to suppress my tears when watching the news or 60 minutes with my family as I felt it was “ wrong, different, too much” …How amazing that I may have permission to feel my complete self with you . Even positive emotions like joy and love are overwhelming for me and my poor little heart that is so full at times it just struggles. Lol … am I scaring you away yet?! 😂😂

So yes my head agrees that slow, patient and careful is best, despite the part of me that yearns for more of you, and it’s protective of our sensitive souls.. xxxxx ",,

I cannot explain these symptoms I am having at our scheduled appointments. I become intensely giddy, light hearted, my brain turns to mush and I lose my appetite - I feel like I could just melt into you. I have just such a strong desire to touch and be close to you. Now that you are gone, and I am just starting to feel a bit clear headed, and seeing that you are my private physician, I have to let you know that I may have taken a little blue pill at a previous appointment. I know, I know it is important for you to be aware of all my medical history. I am so sorry for not privatlely disclosing this with you. I may have just been overwhelmed and a wee bit embarrassed in the moment.

More than happy to discuss more at our next appointment and perhaps you may have a more suitable prescription that works better for me.

I hope day 1 is going well for you . So here is what I would gently recommend but totally no pressure at all - I just wanted to put it down in writing cause I’ll forget what I was thinking . First if you haven’t already I would rule out anything physical/ medical by seeing the gp - even if it’s psychological could still be co existing medical stuff contributing. Next although you have a great therapist I think trying someone who uses EMDR ( eye movement desensitisation and reprocessing) to target intimacy, which is an evidence based form of trauma therapy would be really helpful for you . Your loss was a huge trauma. I’m happy to try do it with you ( I am trained in EMDR ) but usually it’s better not to do therapy on ones dates lol! 😂 so I have the name of a psychologist Sean Cuthbert who comes with high recommendation and does EMDR . Lastly there is a great psych practice called SHIPS ( they focus on intimacy and sexual health) - that whether it’s me or turns out your destiny is with some other lucky chick - would be an option for the future to work in partnership on this. 
Better go and do some work xxxx😘

Oh no not more therapy! Haha. Aww your compassion is one of many things that I adore about you. I am certainly up for unpacking this topic in private if you like - but only as your date lover and best friend - not your client.  But yeah in general Im feeling/hoping that it isn’t as big as an issue for me as it has been in the past - although it was a “big” issue for you on the weekend haha. 🍆 Silly jokes aside, Our Mystery date stands out as the best I have ever had. It was a magical afternoon and evening. I think we were swept away by it all and perhaps some things happened a bit too fast. Us introverted types do feel intensity strongly and part of me wasn’t as relaxed as I could have been at particular moments - the missing admin, our first time etc.  Oh god but seriously, the chemistry between us… 🔥🔥🔥 I have never experienced it so intensely with someone before. I am so grateful that we have be gifted this joy.  Lets protect it.🙏

Anyways, I will go to the GP as part of my 50 year old man check up and check out the physical stuff and of course Dr Foulkes my therapist awaits. I googled /bookmarked EMDR and SHIPS, very fascinating,  it is now in my back pocket just in case.

BTW. I can imagine that dating a widower comes with its own challenges. I value that you have been sharing your feelings about it along the way. Im always open to listen…

First day back is going very well thank you. Actually my feelings about being here is also something we can unpack together another day…

Home is where I want to be
Pick me up and turn me round
I feel numb, burn with a weak heart
I guess I must be having fun
The less we say about it the better
Make it up as we go along
Feet on the ground
Head in the sky
It's ok I know nothing's wrong... nothing
… Hi yo I got plenty of time
Hi yo you got light in your eyes
And you're standing here beside me
I love the passing of time
Never for money
Always for love
… Cover up + say goodnight... say goodnight
Home, is where I want to be
But I guess I'm already there
I come home, she lifted up her wings
Guess that this must be the place
I can't tell one from another
… Did I find you, or you find me?
There was a time before we were born
… If someone asks, this where I'll be where I'll be
Hi yo we drift in and out
Hi yo sing into my mouth
Out of all those kinds of people
You got a face with a view
I'm just an animal looking for a home
Share the same space for a minute or two
And you love me till my heart stops
Love me till I'm dead
Eyes that light up, eyes look through you
Cover up the blank spots
Hit me on the head ah ooh",,

This morning, I woke up to the familiar sight of a colossal jacaranda tree, set against the backdrop of clear blue sky and the north shore train line. 

Intermittently Ive heard the distinctive blend of train sounds as they traverse the tracks, the  rhythmic click-clack, a somewhat comforting beat. 

I’m not home though, I’m just passing through. My heart now ready, to come back home to you… and our driving date!

I can’t remember the last time I organised a pickup up from the airport with someone- other than a professional driver - many, many years. You might be across it more than I am however here is what the Jetstar website recommends 

https://www.jetstar.com/au/en/inspiration/articles/melbourne-tullamarine-t4-guide (https://www.jetstar.com/au/en/inspiration/articles/melbourne-tullamarine-t4-guide)

If you’re picking someone up from Terminal 4, the pick-up zone is on Level 1 of the Terminal 4 Car Park.

Should I come and find you in the pickup zone on level 1 when I get off my flight?",,

Wow you take me back to Sydney and all it’s familiar sounds and sights with your always well chosen words -it’s sooo familiar to me but also slightly jarring that I am now so disconnected from the place. 

I am so excited to pick you up- and even more excited that I can be some one who cares about you to so want to ….don’t worry I am all over the Jetstar terminal 4 pick up - I have picked up Abi 3 times from there in the last 12 months ( she had a Japan, Bali and a QLD trip  all since finishing school!)
I will park and come in and meet you where the baggage carousels are. Will text exact location. Thank you for thinking ahead.

While you so kindly wait, I have last nights write up for you:

Last nights gig was quite the experience! I was right in the mix, feeling like a true middle aged west Sydney bogan, surrounded by cute couples on a date night away from the kids to some nostalgic bad ass dads introducing their pre/young adolescent sons to some rock and titties for the first time haha - kinda like what my dad did for me at the Motley Crue concert in '88. I didn't dive into the mosh pit with the die-hard fans, that's changed now anyway, these days it’s more of a stand there with your phone camera in the air pit 🫤. Def Leppard was epic, especially when they played 'Love Bites' at sunset.

It’s interesting that your text has parallel themes to mine!  Yes! this:

“Saying conscious doesn't preclude the euphoria of an inner tenor when your beloved comes through the door, or the pure joy of spending time together. It means your excitement exists alongside your fears and vulnerability.” 

As exciting as we are, It’s blood scary letting your guard down to who you really are - and first you have to already know and trust in who you are! In this point in my life I feel like I  have a good grip on “me” and as terrifying as it might be for some reason I want to share that “me” with you.

Osho is such a great spiritual writer. He agreed with the spiritual philosopher George Gurdjieff in thinking that for every man there is a corresponding woman somewhere. Also he noted that it can be discovered scientifically and that one should not rush in to finding their match - it could take a lifetime. It has taken a long time for us to find each other yet here we are…You and I at times have tried to make sense of our instantaneous connection - the feeling of already knowing each other. Perhaps these writings shine some light on it all… one thing for sure is that we have been given a gift. With the anticipation of more dates to follow I look forward to seeing where our romantic journey takes us. A delicate balance of the physical (sexual desire) and fostering deep intimacy perhaps prudent.

“But it is rare to find a person who totally fits with you. Whenever somebody is fortunate enough, life is lived with a melody; then there are two bodies and one soul. That is a real couple. And whenever you can find that kind of couple, there will be great grace and great music around them, a great aura, beautiful light, a silence. And love then naturally leads into meditation.”

Oh boy big weekend for me. The airport pickup date was the best! You made me cry so much today -to be loved and cared for after me being the care giver for so many years brought on a deeply emotion experience. I’ll sleep well tonight. Thank you again 🙏🏻 

Levi’s big hug was the equal best hug in the world today.

Can’t wait to see you soon. 😘😘😘 xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx",,

I can’t even express it enough . ..thank you for your vulnerability in your words and the effort you go to to write them. I’m so frickin happy I made you feel cared for - you sooooo deserve it - it was/is an honour to nurture you and care for you. .. I feel so drawn to you it’s not even a conscious process- you are magnetic… I have no choice but to be pulled by this inexplicable chemistry .

Speaking of vulnerability…  (I have decided I will try always to share with you and not suppress  and Osho says “ risk everything for truth” ) It’s funny I came away from our drive home with a sad feeling that surprised me afterwards . I tried to make sense of it and I think I know what it is …. ( and from your text it feels like you are thinking the same thing as me !) The first few weeks there is a bit of presenting yourself in the best light … I think it’s the absolute fear you mention-that to really get to know each other it might hurt a bit and we will see parts of each other soon that are maybe less shiny and attractive, we will be real and imperfect soon- “ we are all crossbreeds after all” 😉
I’m scared cause we are on the precipice and I’m scared of how much I like you and I’m scared to become too attached to you cause if it doesn’t work this will hurt so bad. (Now it’s my turn for tears … ) 
I am so honoured you want to share you with me . I feel the same desire to share myself with you - hence my commitment to be vulnerable with you -I promise to hold your precious heart with care and love ❤️ I too feel I know myself well - I am stronger and more capable than I have ever been- and also more compassionate (thanks years of therapy!🤣)

Your quote talks about “ a great aura, beautiful light, a silence”  … our silences strike me as something divine. I rarely feel ok with silence - except with you …. Osho  says “ language is needed because we don’t know how to communicate… the real medium is silence”  “language is needed to relate to people with whom you have no love relationship. Non language is needed to relate to people with whom you have a love relationship. “ 

Thank you for the journey so far I’ve loved every moment and despite my fear - I’m going in, will keep turning up with you.

And clearly it’s not only me but Levi knows how special you are too with his delicious hug.😊

Can’t wait to see you soon beautiful man.

It's fascinating how perceptions can vary among us individuals. It is interesting that you misperceived my desire to make food not only taste good but also visually appealing as perfectionism. Let me take you by the hand and show you how beautiful the world can be - especially in imperfection . I’ll lead the way if you like but don’t undervalue yourself, you have such a big heart, keep it wide open and you will see it everywhere.

Haha it is hard to imagine us having a fight but that’s one part of being a couple I guess. If we do, perhaps we might find the whole experience too emotionally draining and then go and have a nap in separate corners…. 😴 Wake up one hour later, put our excellent conflict resolution skills to work and celebrate our well earned truce with fucking amazing make up sex. 😉 Let’s make that the benchmark. 😊 

Let me get back to you on the play and I’ll write back in the morning, It’s a great idea! I just want to have a good look at the link you sent me. I think the weekend has finally caught up with me tonight and I’ve hit a brick wall. 🥱

This poem is for you … 

What I love about you : 

I love that you wear your heart on your sleave, 
That your eyes are so damn blue, 
I love that you are sooo much smarter than me, 
Top 5% - I hear that’s true! 
I love that you write texts to me, 
With words from a mind so bright, 
They fill up my heart so gleefully- 
Make me laugh and feel so light, 
I love your reliability- 
You always do as you say, 
I’m thrilled at our exclusivity, 
Your directness is the best sweet Na, 
I love how you echo the kisses I write, 
So attuned to what I might feel, 
I love your ‘bad boy’ streak and your height, 
Don’t let me wake, I pray this is real! 
I love your wise intensity, 
And your sweet dad playful nature too, 
The thought of a present- some green tea- 
I think I’m falling into you. 
I love the chemistry- who be explaining? 
Maybe its cause you fast overnight?! 
Or perhaps that you’re  INFJ-ing ?! 
Dunno why just keep holding me tight. 
I love that you’re  half Scottish “ och aie the noo” 
And therapy is part of your life’s decree, 
I love that for me a movie was watched twice by you, 
And you tested me psychometrically! 
I loved when you held me, oh yes! Oh yay 
And with music together we moved and swayed,
Love will guide us across the freeway, 
To a place called home- that’s our crusade.

I wish I could wrap my arms around you and squeeze you very tight right now… soon.  My sharp mind finds yours incredible stimulating too- just as much as your scent and our gaze.

Im not going anywhere, this is real. 

I’m reading your book, I like very much this concept of a relationship bubble. Exclusivity, privacy and a safe space where both individuals feel secure and free to be themselves without judgment or external influence. I think that it is a good sign that even in our early stages we have already begun to pave a way for this way of couple being. Across a stretch of freeway, that is what a place called home feels like for me.

I love how “Winds of Change” and our other songs celebrate the hope and optimism associated with the end of an era and the beginning of a new one.  I am excited by the possibilities.

On the same theme but with vulnerability and contemplation attached, you can’t go past Stevie Nicks “Landslide”. A beautiful metaphor representing a significant and potentially overwhelming shift in one’s life. Whether it is your kids growing up,  getting older or falling in love with a new love again. The older you get the more you self reflect as you walk through the inevitably of change. 

We could go on when it comes to songs about change…

Haha maybe after what we have been through Tracy Chapmans fast car is the most apt. lol

“You got a fast car
I want a ticket to anywhere
Maybe we make a deal
Maybe together we can get somewhere
Any place is better”

Hope you are having a great day! xx",,

Thanks for the link, I’m always looking for new content and that one looks juicy.

Work has been a bit of a cluster fuck in the last 24 hours with an urgent business requirement that came out of nowhere. They have thrown a lot of resources at it though so I don’t feel like it’s all on my shoulders. It looks like the fire has died down now but still it’s been a bit of a adrenaline/cortisol rush for “the new guy” haha And now Levi and I are about to host Lara and lovely Bella (her nine year old daughter )for a b dinner 🥳 I haven’t gone to too much trouble, just bought some take away salads and will heat up my pasta sauce with some Orochetii. But still, it’s nice to be able to share with my partner in crime that a little part of me would rather have quiet time tonight and couldn’t bf 😉 

Let me get back to you in the morning around 10:00. If all is clear I would soooooo love to see you in the 12:00pm to 2:00pm ballpark. Otherwise we will be seeing each other very soon. 🥰 

Fingers crossed your Fitzroy client list builds up soon - these things take time🤞xxx",,

Wow you have had a cocktail of biochemistry what with all that cortisol at work and the oxytocin that we generate together - your brain must be so confused.  I hope things are a little less overwhelming for you  and that your dinner went well even if you felt a bit depleted. 

Ok let me know about tomorrow- no probs . One of the directors asked for me to meet with him at 11.15 tomorrow for a check in and supervision (? !Not sure what cause nothing much has happened yet ) . We are meeting in McKinnon so don’t have to go to Fitzroy . Shouldn’t take more than an hour …

Good news! No surprises, my GP has told me I’m azoospermic and STD free - and that my cholesterol has gone down! Attached are my test results for your consideration and extra opinion.

We did discover more today didn’t we? I’ve never told anyone about the thumb sucking - I must feel very not judged by you to disclose that - let’s bury that away forever now lol 😝

Your Kanteen/Botanical gardens idea sounds fab. I am dispatching Levi at the East Melbourne shule around midday for a Warrandyte sleepover. I am all yours from midday onwards… 

Todays prose is a quote, from Jack Kerouac's great novel 'On the Road”.

'You only need one man to love you. But him to love you free like a wildfire, crazy like the moon, always like tomorrow, sudden like an inhale and overcoming like the tides. Only one man and all of this.”

A love that is intense, ever-changing, and perhaps a bit unpredictable like the moon.

A love that is enduring and constant, always present, and looking toward the future.

A love that can be likened to the breath - something that happened unexpectedly, swiftly, and naturally.

A love that is strong, capable of overcoming challenges - or obstacles like the tides.

Well it’s no surprise sweet man, your scores - cause you are an exceptionally high standard of person overall - looks like some differences here between us but will be interesting to see how we fare …. My email is melaniestrang@protonmail.com 

Yay to therapy for reducing that neuroticism score - one diff between us is your high intellect - according to this silly test I’m a dummy in this area lol.😂

My introversion was on full display at the neighbours Shabbat dinner last night ( which went in foreverrrrr gd help me why did I agree to go?!) 
There was lots of political talk which sends me straight into my shell, but made friends with the lovely nana and she liked that I told her she looked young - she probs just topped up on the Botox that day but  hey it made her feel good  so yeah !  Some excellent and funny storytellers around the table but enough already with funny stories by 8.30 for me 😴🥺

Intellect in the big 5 is a measure of an interest in abstract ideas, while IQ is a measure of processing speed. So you ain’t no dummy - it’s just the spatial/abstract thinking where we probably differ. Ok I sent a request to your email.

That’s cute I do the same thing as those long boring dinners. I always gravitate to the old and wise - they always have plenty of interesting stories to tell. So glad you felt included and toasty, but yeah sounds like the evening dragged on a little bit for you - politics 🥱. Perhaps next time I’ll rescue you, send me a text to call you with an emergency haha 

Earlier on at the week I felt like an olympic athlete at the gym but this morning I really felt my age - a bit of muscle fatigue perhaps. Would love to take you up on that offer for a lift!  - I love cruising around with you at the wheel.  If I drop Levi off at the shule around 12, I can be back at 1:00pm easily - perhaps be a wee bit early if you are keen. I’m getting excited already just thinking about it.

I think that there may have been a bit of a communication mix up amongst the super cute Gibson playfulness. I was checking in with you on how you were feeling today - last time you mentioned feelings of guilt in relation to Romy, of which I thought was totally reasonable and also validation of the very special person you are - the empathy oh my😘. She actually hasn’t been with me at all lately but her birthday is coming up on the 18th of December- while you are away. I look forward to channeling her, taken myself into that special space and letting her know that I have found someone very special and that Im now in very good hands. ☺️ Just let me know if you ever want to talk about it no stress. 😎 

That sucks you felt a bit on the crap side today. And yeah I get that you are going through a big change in your life so it must be tricky having that one eye open. I was totally cool with the change of plans. I don’t get rattled much these days. I ended up having the cutest FT with Pepper. Omg she is incredibly beautiful - inside and out .

Oh I had no idea that you were asking about the guilt… I didn’t feel guilty whilst we were deeply intimate so it’s not front of mind when we are together …  I’m just enjoying you … it’s more when I’m alone reflecting so yes I do still feel guilty and when I think of Romy ‘s family and potentially meeting them one day I think that would be very hard for me - cause how can we be happy that we met each other when they ( and you) lost their beautiful girl- still not sure how to tackle this tbh.  It makes me feel selfish or bad in some way …  it’s something I’m going to need to work on and will need lots of your reassurance… .it’s also a unique situation that you will always love her and be connected to her - it’s a lot to get my head around - hello insecure anxious attachment lol! 

I didn’t tell you before but whilst I was doing EMDR with my psychologist she suddenly spoke as if she were Romy and said “ bless you  Melanie for looking after my boys” - this was said in the very early days of dating and I gave the psychologist no indication that I thought this could potentially turn into a relationship so that was a surprising statement that she made- perhaps it was Romy speaking through her? 

I was actually wondering when Romy’s birthday was - that’s important- so thank you for letting me know. If you feel any answers from Romy to this guilt please do share! 

I’m glad you got to connect with your beautiful Pepper and will see her soon . 
Hope your Monday goes well. Miss you lots 🥰

Good luck with the naturopath. Also one of my favourite podcasters has great podcasts on optimising sleep.  Andrew Huberman  is a neuroscientist and tenured professor in the department of neurobiology,  psychiatry and behavioural sciences at Stanford School of Medicine.

This one on is on his sleep supplements recommendation.

And this one in general

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2aWYjSA1Jc (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2aWYjSA1Jc)

I’m also just enjoying you at the moment but yeah there is potential for some hurdles down the road whether it be blended families to living along side Romy’s memory. But it’s important that you know we have a safe place where we can always ask each other for help, rely on one another, and share our vulnerabilities. My priority is support and protection of us along way - which is why I checked in on you.  Relationship bubble. 😉 haha

That is interesting that your psychologist spoke as if she was Romy in that way - very spiritual. In the last few years she referred to Levi and myself as her “boys” very often. There is so much that I can share with you about my 8 years with her. It wasn’t an easy relationship and in fact I was quite ambivalent about it - that seemed to be the theme for many years in therapy. Like a constant tug of war it pulled me back and forth or even simultaneously in opposite directions. That was not a great way of being. Since her passing I feel like I have been liberated from that. It feels great to be living my life as my true self again. And I can still tap into the love we had when my heart calls for her. That time will be around her birthday for sure - let me get back to you with my experience with her this time around.

Anyway no rush with this heavy stuff. You have a lot going on and lightness is also important for us as our relationship grows. Hey I was just deleting my RSVP account today and couldn’t believe how great our writing was to each other before we had even met! - I saved it. We really did just click from the get go. It means so much to me that we take the time to write to each other - and because we really want to🥰

Good news my chariot will be fully serviced by today so I can proudly drive my girl
 to our mystery date on Wednesday evening. I can’t wait! I miss you lots too…🥰 

❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️",,

I won’t take that for granted, ever. 

Your text is sooo reassuring and I want so much an openness, connectedness, a vulnerable partnership - a soft place to land where we both can feel loved and supported no matter what comes up. Gd knows I’ve spent years reading about it so I know the theory - now it’s time for the practical component of this life lesson 😉- I always did like the hands on lab work! Not that I’m referring to us as a lab experiment 😂 

I got goose pimples when you said Romy referred to you and Levi as “ her boys” … that’s the stuff of knowing that we are only privy to/ conscious of a very small slither of our world.. that’s the spirituality we spoke about on date number 1 . I do believe that might have been the sign I was looking for 😊…thank you for being so open and helping me understand your relationship a little more.

Yes there will be hurdles , many we are not ready for yet and some more simpler worries like my concern that I will always be sous chef and you, chef … that’s ok I’m good at taking directions and I’m a great cleaner upper 😂.

I am seeing Genya tomorrow and look forward to listening to the podcasts - thanks for caring about me 🥰 Maybe next time I see you I will be a rested 8 hour a night kinda woman! 

Can’t wait to sit next to you in your non status symbol bmw chariot for our second mystery date 😉

Lots of love xxxxxx❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️😘",,

An excerpt I just read from your book:

“No book or audiotape, workshop, or religion can alter our sense of relation ship security, In other words, as far as relationships go, we are hurt by people and yet we can be healed only by people.”

Haha aww my sweet I would love to share the chefs hat with you. I do too easily get carried away with my creativity and aesthetics - we can work on that 😉- at the end of the day I also like to be loved and cared for as well. Can’t wait to have a home meal cooked all by you one day - and I’ll clean up. 🥰

Big day tomorrow with a trip into the city, therapy and scouts. We have delivered as a team,at my new job, our first big piece so no stress there. So pleased you are seeing Genya tomorrow. Hope she gets to do a guided meditation with you as well.🙏🏻

Looking forward to whisking away from the prying eyes of the local sticky beaks and having you all to myself for an evening. Can’t wait!

I have lost myself though in the kitchen and am keen to find my way back… I was quite pleased with my Sunday slower cooking outcomes😊

Yes people heal with other people - like we spoke about- that’s the aim of therapy - a model of a healthy vulnerable relationship where you feel seen heard and there are no consequences. Good relationships can provide the same as well so even an insecure person might change their attachment style to secure within a couple in a reliable relationship where they know the person always has their back, and will always turn towards.

Enjoy your busy day - not only are our cars in sync but our therapy appointment times too - I am seeing mine this afternoon as I do every second Tuesday .
Along with the car service, naturopath, a random online client appointment and some reports to write that will be a full day .

Work sounds like it went satisfyingly well for you  yesterday 😊- it will be great to be whisked away by you tomorrow night - I have no clue ( just as you like it!) what you have up your sleeve. 🥺😊

The results are IN ! So there are many wonderful matching and complimentary pieces of us and some bits to look out for. Here I will highlight those bits as I see them, not to be negative but so we can be proactive…
I need to ensure I communicate my needs so that I don’t get resentful, we both could end up self sacrificing in a parent role ( although I think I am slightly better now at allowing myself to have a life too and I think you do the same), as a couple we may avoid conflict cause we are so damn polite, thank you very much! …both of us have high standards ( that could get annoying! lol) I may find it hard to assert myself with you, I’ll more likely feel anxious or rejected and more likely to withdraw,  your volatility is higher but I reckon you’ve worked a lot on that .
The one thing that came from this testing that I had already flagged in my mind from the very start is that you are a creative, abstract intellect … maybe a little eccentric. I’m a little less creative and more conventional ( in comparison to you but within my family of origin I’m seen as the eccentric one, the different one, the one who deviates) …do you see this difference as a concern?  I love this side of you .. I might end up being boring to you 🥱 but then I can just draw on my extremely high compassion levels and empathise with you on how hard that might be for you haha !  Ok that’s my take - look forward to hearing your thoughts xxxxxxx❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️",,

It is very sweet that we are both high in agreeableness, compassion and politeness. It is most likely true that others would see us as a lovely couple  🥰. Perhaps a rather conflict free relationship lies ahead for us, however with your very high compassion, I would hate to see you fall into a trap of resentment if your own needs and interests fail to be met. With me being the slightly more assertive one perhaps I can use that skill to shine a light of discovery on our true desires when needed - perhaps be the more dominant one. In the bedroom it looks like we will both want to serve the other rather than get our own pleasures so perhaps we will have to learn how to take turns - coin toss? Haha

Putting aside the cuteness of our agreeableness, compassion and politeness what I really also love about us is that we are both high in conscientiousness. This can be backed up by evidence with our own great achievements in parenting and careers to date. This makes it easy for us understand each other’s drives and motivations in life - and be accepting of them. These traits would most likely crossover to a willingness to keep our relationship in good health. Same with the industriousness, we both have good values such as meeting our obligations, showing up on time and handling the day to day life responsibilities very well. All good stuff to help make a relatonship harmonious.

Looks like our extroversion is nicely balanced. We are not wanting to be at home all the time but also not wanting to partying all the time either! And both of us aint that neurotic, Ah thanks therapy :) Hmm yes the high in volatility sounds like me. But like I said it is just low levels of irritability these days compared to years ago. Ive learnt how to deal with my stress by exercising, avoiding alcohol  and getting good sleep. If you do experience it with me perhaps your off the charts compassion can help me calm down and become more stable again.

Okay what’s pretty much left over is the abstract thinking and creativity. That is a quite a big difference that we both were already aware of - although I have really enjoyed your creativity as a writer. To be honest I don’t need to be strictly equally matched in this area. In fact I already gave that a go in my first marriage. Both Kate and myself are highly creative intellects and the truth is we spent most of our relationship siloed in our own creative worlds with no one to truly appreciate it. But if you love this side to me then great! I would love nothing more to be able to freely express this side to my love. BTW I am actually quite conventional too - don’t forget I went to a very conservative private boys school for 12 years - but having said that my parents were called to the headmasters office a few times haha.

Oh boy it’s been a bit to unpack here and Im sure we will discuss it more in person as we continue to learn more about each other. Thanks so much for doing this little test with me. I love that we are both highly analytical truth seekers. I couldn’t be more happier with the information we have collected so far. You are a bloody great catch Melanie Strang! xxxxxxx❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️",,

I like the idea of having a slightly more dominant partner -  it would make me feel held… in my relationship with Paul - I used to feel I was running the show and making all the decisions as he was very passive - I desperately wanted some input from him and it felt so lonely not having someone with strong opinions of their own. 

I think I’ve got what it takes to nurse that irritable fire in your belly should it flare up - I just see it as passion- a close cousin of irritability.  I feel like I know you and connect to you better if you emote - not to turn this into a comparison but Paul had a very narrow range of emotions which made it hard to understand what was going on for him.

I love your take on our differences around creativity - thanks to your quick thinking mind! I would be very comfortable and delighted to be your biggest cheerleader, the one to receive the fruits of your crazy  mind- play me your music, share with me your ideas, create away and I will be honoured to be that place where it lands - I can be the Nathan fan club - I already am! I also had the thought that my quieter less complex mind may be the calm that you feel when you are with me so we may be more complimentary than we think in that area.

After all that testing , it’s interesting but what matters as well that no test can uncover  is we have this pull to be together, a magic attraction and together a meltworthy gaze  😘

Can’t wait to see you soon so we can  spend the evening being polite conscientious, and agreeable together❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️",,

Why wait? What for? 🤷🏻‍♀️ 

I was a little negative last night about Sue Johnson’s belief that one can keep on falling in love with their partner .. - on reflection I do think it’s possible but it takes a lot of hard “work “and conscientiousness - maybe with our strong attraction and our ability to put in the work and deep desire to find that special connection we are the perfect duo to illustrate it’s possible to be in love forever ❤️

I will never take your warmth for granted either and wish for many more savoury drops of kindness between us because you are truly MY cauldron of comfort .

Here is my dream from last night for your wondrous mind to ponder over: we are driving ( you in driver seat) around in your car and we’re looking for the right direction on your map … you thought you found the right way but then I noticed you went straight back where we had just come from . I told you that we were heading back to where we came from and you felt a bit upset or at fault in some way but you agreed that I could drive your car to help us get to our destination.  … Look forward to hearing your analysis !

And results of genetic testing - no increase risk ovarian cancer . No genetic mutations at all for breast cancer . 
They put all the info into an algorithm and came up with a 14% risk of a second breast cancer between now and end of life . The average risk for a 49 year old is 9% - so I’m at 5% higher risk than average . Does that bother/worry / have any implications  for you much? Maybe it’s at this point you should swipe right on Tamara Kuldin cause she probs only has a 9% risk lol😆just joking .. she would swallow you whole! 

Hope your afternoon has provided a bit more recovery for you lovely. It was a delightful half hour with you today xxxxx❤️❤️❤️",,

Hmm your dream and hence your subconscious… the car may symbolise the direction in your life, the journey that you are currently on. I guess the map may indicate that you are seeking clarity in your current path. However there does seem to be an undercurrent of fear in you. The driver going backwards might symbolise you feeling stuck in some aspect of your life, which could possibly reflect a fear of repeating past mistakes. Are you upset by these mistakes?, are you holding yourself accountable? - as Nathan was? Like I keep saying to you, “Two things can be true at once” so yes you carry your fears but the change of driver may also symbolise your willingness to want to let go of them, explore alternative approaches to reach your goal of happiness. Agreeing to let someone else drive could be a positive sign that you are open to new perspectives and willing to collaborate with others to achieve this objective. With me being an intimate person in your life, I would love to think that person is me!🤞 Ok that is just my inexperienced interpretation.. thanks for letting me explore deep into your mind.  BTW I ❤️❤️❤️ your 🧠.      
    
Ok I like those odds you have presented me there. Take good care of yourself and keep getting those regular checkups and that should put you in better stead than those oblivious 9 percenters! Haha you know me so well already - yes the honest truth is that the sweet sensitive side of me may have been a little intimidated by the sultry Tamara Kuldin - not somebody I would want to be ravished by haha. I would rather have the intense, passionate, magnetic and captivating gaze of Melanie Strang any day! Oh gosh, oh my that gaze… 🥰🥰🥰 

Oh god the afternoon, I don’t want to pull you into my dramas but lets just say someone, the senior engineer that started with me, spectacularly quit after you left and I had to deal with the fallout of that with Origin Energy management and my recruiter. I missed the school pickup and poor little Levi was picked up by his emergency contact. Oh dear, anyway all is good now. Im having a coffee with my manager next Tuesday and I’ll get a bit more transparency but yeah it looks like I’ve joined at a chaotic time with the business. I’ll give them the benefit of the doubt and hang my hat on that for now. I’m going on holidays soon so it looks like that’s next year’s problem! Haha that list is growing and growing…

The poetic chicken soup came in real handy though. Levi loved it too, it’s a quiet rainy night tucked up inside now with no adventures of mini golf.😴This virus I have seems to have presented me with minor symptoms so lets hope it stays this way.🤞

Your love helped. xxxxx❤️❤️❤️",,

You can see I'm sure that I'm a worrier so to combat this I create mantras for myself in my head to remind me that you are not Paul: ' This is the man who writes chicken soup poetry,  this is romantic and empathetic Nathan,  its not Paul'  I would love if that person to move forward with on the map of life ( even if we do take a few wrong turns) is you my love....wouldn't that be amazing?!

 I'm in the middle of watching this You tube interview with Jordan Peterson ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdQ71Syokus ) who talks about creative people being more attuned to Jungian therapy and non creatives just simply don't get it.
It got me thinking about my creativity as I loved the Jungian way, the symbols, archetypes, interweaving of stories and fairytales. I even thought of training in it  and still would love to but its a huge commitment.  I have had the thought before that my creativity was trained out of me- I used to be a  playful performer- always in shows as a young kid but then I became really self conscious and stopped ( maybe being wacked my mum had something to do with it)...writing was always there but then I studied science (medicine) and became a scientist. My brain was rewired. It's more complex than the big 5 cause people are so nuanced and a test just can't capture that. Another example of the complex nuance is that Peterson says if you are open and creative you are usually not orderly and conscientious but you are both!
BTW have you watched the Jonah Hill Netflix documentary called Stutz- omg if not that can be our next date- I would love to watch that with you. There are some Jungian references in there.

I'm glad the stats have your approval - My conscientiousness will ensure ongoing health check ups and a lifestyle which may reduce the odds. 

Your afternoon sounds a little less relaxing than one would hope for. It's the politics at work that is usually the hardest part rather than the actual job.  You must have been all consumed by that but glad you are snuggled at home with Levi now and he enjoyed the warm soup too. Fuel for your mini Picasso to generate his next art work!

 Well sweet, sensitve Nathan (I totally adore that side of you and am besotted by it), keep resting and recovering ....sending you your nightly prescription of love ...lots of it xxxxx❤️❤️❤️",,

Melanie,2023-11-25 09:04:03,,,,iMessage,Outgoing,,,Read,,,"I would love an opportunity to keep driving along with you beautiful, united we could have our fears of running out of petrol, navigational disagreements, parking challenges, traffic jams and even getting lost. We could make a pact to analyse and overcome them - keep driving too! It is lucky we have our fears. Confronting them builds resilience, self-confidence, and adaptability. Newly found romance at our age is great because we have maturity, self-awareness and shared life experiences. But one downside is that we bring baggage from previous relationships - eg past hurts, trust issues and anxieties of repeating past mistakes. With time, self-reflection, communication, and intentional efforts we can both move forward in this area. It feels like we are both doing these things already as we drive along at a pace that feels safe - for me anyway. 

Thanks for the JP link - I have listened to his podcasts and content a  fair bit. He is also a fellow INFJ. I have most certainly felt your creativity. You created our mystery date! And the little SOCKS note you gave me with my present. And your quick witted joked about your third son Adam in your addict. Haha you are the best. 

I was born an extremely unconscientious and disorderly little boy who was often told to stop day dreaming.  I rebelled to the conformity of my conservative upbringing but I guess having eccentric parents was a good thing in way. But It did toke a lot longer for me to adapt to an orderly, industrious and conscientious way of being. I think for me it was a necessity of survival, in a world that doesn’t much value the creative ones and to be able to provide for my family. At middle age Ive managed to find a balance where I still deeply feed and express my creative side - through music playing, cooking and now by being in an intimate relationship with you.

I haven’t seen Stutz yet and would love to have a NetFlix and couch date with you! That’s sounds perfect right now. 🥰

I am taking it easy this morning - dropping Levi off at a family birthday party and then some time to myself to decompress after a somewhat demanding week - physically and mentally. I think I might head down to the beach with Muffin.

Your nightly prescription of love was the perfect dose! xxxxx❤️❤️❤️",,

I’m still in a trance from your touch, a little sleepy too.  Lots of brotherly references- your faster breathing made me want to hold you a little tighter🤗

I led you straight to that roadworthy metaphor predicting you would run with it and you did! In true Nathan style …. Yes a pact to communicate and overcome and road bumps sounds like the gps of a sound relationship.  The pace feels safe for me too - except maybe the potential  opportunity to share a bathroom with you in  2 weeks time for 5 days  ha ha  that’s a speeding ticket though I’m willing to be slapped with ! 
I am so mindful too that for you to flourish the road trip  of life needs to not be set roads with demanding routes but a blank page for you to create your own unique , innovative and original map… don’t let me ever forget that ( I’ve never been in a relationship with a creative so in true scientist style I am researching how this works, what you need, in

I just finished describing you to my walking friend Nici, and as I heard all the words tumble out my mouth, I couldn't believe how wonderful you are!  
As we sit on the precipice of safe driving  and  full pedal to the metal, I'm so grateful that you are my co-navigator on this romantic journey. I was going to write about all my fears in response to your invitation, but on reading my initial response it almost felt ike I was subconsciously trying to sabotage things by focusing on my fears so intensely. The thing is, there will always be fears and we will talk about them face to face ( yours and mine) but the fear part of me is not  nearly as strong as the curiosity part. THAT's how I approach life now - yes, there is a  very small part of me that feels fear and intimidation at times AND there is a bigger more curious part that says... wow look at this  incredible man,  what would it be like to fully let yourself go and fall into him?' Its not about the fear, but the life lesson the fear generates. Maybe with you  the lesson is to consolidate the belief that self worth does not  lie in what I and others do/study/acheive but in fact mine and others  self worth lies in how a person makes you feel, their essence- I give you a  calm comapanionship, a gentle place to feel heard and understood,  compassion and love.....you give me a passion to live again, a reminder to wake up, a feeling of safety and love.  I feel so good with you, and I need to settle some of those fearful parts down so I can relax a little more and enjoy you. All I have to do is tell my fearful parts how bored I would be dating a bogan, and I'm right back with you !! I'll take your creative poetry, long winding texts and well cut cucumbers over boganville any day.....ah you just make my heart melt.🥰😘
Thank you for spotting Abi's impeccable timing and her deeply present heart- you have amazing intuition from one piece of music- you have just met her. I hope your carb loading day with Levi was / is connecting and beautiful.

Yes please to your amazing version of Misty - passionate and dreamy AND brilliant! Thank you I thank you so much ! You are amazing 🤩 ..
While you guys were soaking up culture, Ab,  Zach and I have just finished lining our bodies up on the floor and seeing if Gibson could clear 3 bodies in one jump as we threw the ball over us - such a sweet moment of playfulness again between us 🥰
I found another one of Abi s recordings - this time she was 10 yrs old - I was videoing it from my old laptop so poor quality …
Can’t wait to see you again - let me know when you are free this week . I have some time on Monday or Tuesday before the rest of the week heats up…

Thank you so much for accepting the vulnerable invitation to take care of my somewhat fragmented heart. I also gratefully accept the exclusive key to your hot sexy body - and with the all tasty trimmings that come with it! - a fair trade right? lol 😉. Haha, you already know that Im here for the full package…  heart, mind, body and soul 🥰Ah you have found yourself with a complex man haven’t you?

Please don’t forget the poetic instruction manual that comes in the box: ❤️‍🩹🎁💝

Imaginations run wild in the corridors of her mind,
Locked away, a treasure trove for he will find.
Embrace the key she’s gifted you chosen one,
For It will unlock the gates where fantasies run.
In the heart's dim chambers, a tale unfolds,
A man, once bold, now in the shadows, he holds.
A key in hand, heavy with the weight of past pain,
With fears to unlock where fantasies reign.He knows the key holds potential to restore,
But the ache of loss, he can't ignore.
It will take time, a gentle, patient climb,
To open the gates, to a love sublime.

Fear not, oh heart, for time shall be the guide,
To mend the wounds, to let love inside.A wounded heart, an intricate design,
That yearns to be loved and cross the line.

In reflecting upon my past, perhaps I’ve underestimated the number of naughty escapades a wee bit.😬 Im a very passionate man and that has a way of seeping into the bedroom with a great big roar sometimes! 🦁
With great gratitude, thankfully our special connection transcends the ordinary realms of casual encounters. We're not rushed by the whims of casual relationships - instead, we understand the value of time and patience in building something meaningful.

There are moments when impatience tempts me though to hit the fast-forward button, eager to level up into the delight of what we're becoming. Yet, I know that genuine love and trust are seeds that require careful nurturing - and time to blossom. 
In those moments, I also reflect on the extraordinary fortune we share in finding each other. Our personalities, so unique and rare. Meeting you has just been amazing and my sensitive little mind and heart is just trying to process it all - and keep up! 

Do you feel this way too?",,

Until your heart again feels bold,
No need to suddenly open a door,
My newly found hurt amour .
Remember I too have been hurt my love,
So slow and steady is more than enough….

I do feel the same - there is a part of me that wants to be a bigger part of your life and another part that whispers … slow down.  You have been through so much and  the pace your heart needs is the pace we shall take.   Please remember I have been hurt too  in other ways so we are more matched than you think . If you need to hold back on intimacy just say..  I don’t feel I truely understand yet what is happening for you , your fears but I guess as you trust me more over time I will be let deeper into your mind .  
Your beautiful boy is also the highest priority in this and until we are certain about us, he needs to be protected from the uncertainty of early beginnings as we slowly work this out . You are a complex soul and that’s what I love about you And  this isn’t a simple romance either.. but I feel I’m equipped though it will be an emotional journey- that’s what I wanted compared to the drought I came from ! 
The pace is also perfect for my broken heart - not through death but abandonment and hurt .. and here it is… something in your text upset me . Although I’m really pleased you told me a more accurate version of your body count exists , I am so incredibly sensitive to non transparency given what I went through .  I acknowledge you quickly come to the truth and that settles me a bit but anything that deviates from total truth feels like a dagger, a pain so harsh it wakes me from my romantic slumber and scares me to tears … so here it is, our first deviation from the drunken lovefest we have revelled in . … so what is your actual body count ?!  I realised by myself it couldn’t be 10 as when I reminded myself I have probs been with around 10  men in some sort of intimate way - so maybe by me judging the number 10 as a lot that stopped you from speaking your truth - I take my part in this! Please reassure me that truth will always be priority ? 
I like that you have discovered one of my triggers- it’s an opportunity to deepen us away from the illusion of perfection.  I’m so grateful too that we met….-please hold my key tenderly and carefully too cause we are both worth waiting for to fully unlock  and  maybe even one day move towards a place that feels like a home where keys and locks are no longer needed.

I really had to dive the deepest depths of my oceans to even come up with a a rough number. In the last 24 hours I may have discovered a few more on the way up to the surface is all - I do like to give you accurate information where possible. My number probably isn’t even that much higher than yours! I think your interpretation of this pillow talk exchange as non transparency or even deception was perhaps an understandable miscalculation. It’s telling. I’m sorry you were dealt with a deceptive husband. That must of really fucking sucked. I can see very clearly that this is your pain to my pangs of loss. If it is ok with you can we please put the lid back on this frisky can of past worms? All I think about is us. We both clearly agree that it’s going to take time to grow but I can’t tell you how much I believe in us, our potential to heal and grow into each other. I really don’t think our baggage is that challenging to deal with to be honest - it’s quite manageable. God those poor people out there who were sexually abused as children. Nah we will be fine - and we are only springs chickens, we have time on our side. 

Yes that beautiful boy. And your kids too. We will make sure they don’t get hurt too. Let me get back to you with Levi’s piano recital this year so we can continue our theme of talented little people.

Fourteen years ago my phone rang . It was you on the other end. But you didn’t know you rang me. You with your woman touching her breast .  I called you back and you lied saying you were alone in your hotel room, not knowing that the pocket dial told me everything. 
Fourteen years ago you said you would stop. So we went to couples therapy yet you kept on . I found the string of emails professing your love for each other even though you both knew it was wrong.

Fourteen years ago you changed my beautiful children’s lives forever . They would now grow up without loving parents but with two separate disconnected units holding a family secret. 

Fourteen years ago you disclosed that you cheated on me even before we were married.

The clues were there - one day we went out for dinner when I visited you in Melbourne and the owner said as we walked in “ oh you are with a different lady tonight”  I thought I must have misheard so I let it go. If only I’d held on to it .
14 years ago the long hard distressing journey as a lonely parent began - worse still - no one knew we were not a couple. My grief was so intense I literally dragged myself through each day for years, saving the only energy I had to be present for my babies.

42 days ago I met a beautiful man- a complex but beautiful and honest man. Today the devastated part of me that was emotionally left alone to raise our children, accused him of lying to me. I could have sworn he was lying - that’s what trauma does. It takes a part of you and tells it never to trust again! It puts a blindfold of sabotage on what is actually happening right now in front of you. It’s so powerful it can make the brightest of souls look like a villain.

So  1 hour ago I made a promise to myself . I won’t let this 14 year old betrayal continue to steer the relation- “ship” aground. Let me float back to calmer waters where now is now and people are good.  Tomorrow I will begin again, navigating the beauty of what is current and believing that the blindfold of distress can be removed and thrown deep into the sinking muddy waters behind me.",,

I was really upset at myself last night  but with reflection have come full circle and realised this is very strengthening for us . The mis - attunement followed by a repair and understanding are what builds up a relationship. Had I just suppressed what I felt  rather than present it to you like I did, I would have weakened us . … so I think it’s all in all a helpful incident though I do feel a bit raw and exposed . It’s definitely set something off in me demanding that I work on the infidelity more ( I have totally avoided it in Therapy) - I cried for hours last night - my heart needing to finally allow myself to feel sad for my loss.  This processing has only happened because I’m with you - I didn’t seem to have a need nor a way to work through it as a single person  for years…. So thanks for helping me heal a little more. 

A good sign that we are both so aware and insightful that we can work through things . That process we just completed I have never done before with a close intimate person … how refreshing! 

And my period just arrived which partly explains as well the over reactive over emotional responses.. and teariness. I should go back to my more rational self  for 3 weeks now lol.

Our writing yesterday was brilliant. It had lust, deep fantasies, deception and betrayal. We should write a romantic novel together! 

I presented an awareness to you that it was only a matter of time that my pain would be exposed to you, unaware that yours was playing out in realtime right in front of me!

This riveting narrative twist swiftly endeared me to the protagonist, establishing a remarkably deep human connection in the early stages of this developing novel.

Mum is staying with us in January so perhaps we can get a hotel room together so I can touch your breasts and make an accidental butt dial -ohhhh revenge the plot thickens haha  😉 

Divorce sucks - I’ve been through it too. It will take some years to heal and repair - similar to loss and grief.

I’m not sure how my real time pain will play out in front of you.  Maybe it might not happen at all - I don’t want to self sabotage. But I feel safe now that I have given possession of my wounded heart too.

Sigh… we are such an amazing fit on so many levels.

I had the thought that these texts in themselves could be adapted into a book - your words especially are so poetic, romantic… beautiful 😍 and your words make me feel safe - that’s what I need to keep focussing on . They land on my broken heart like a soothing tonic, slowly helping me trust again. 

Ha ha maybe I’m an attention seeker: as you were in deep exploration of your   Grief Wound, in I jumped with my own pain. … look at me, look at MY Betrayal Wound whaaaaa! 

You are a very funny man lol - I giggled out loud at your suggestion to  seek revenge - all great love stories have an element of vengeful retaliation so butt- dial away - preferably when we are in the throes of desiring each other in one of those yet unspoken fantasies, in the height of climax, so he hears our deep loving connection! The one he so blatantly threw away - well we never had it in the first place.
Yes please to a steamy night in a hotel with you, caressing my breasts, fine man. 


I adore you ,  cherish you , admire you … your patience with my pain, how you still see me as your connected protagonist despite my deviation from the path of bliss,  the way you plagiarise your own words in subsequent texts…😂 I am filled with excitement to know you more. Thank you , I deeply  deeply DEEPLY appreciate you. 

All my love and desire - every bit of it for you my love xxxxxxx❤️❤️❤️❤️🌕

I’ve thought about how our volume of texts could be adapted into a book too! haha. Here’s my pitch:

Tired of the prevailing stigma surrounding the challenges of online dating?

“In “Beyond Swipes (or perhaps Love Bytes haha): A Guide to 21st Century Love”, Nathan and Melanie unveil the romantic potential hidden beneath the surface of modern dating, showcasing it as an enchanting experience rather than a daunting one. By blending the old world charm of handwritten expressions with the digital language of today, Nathan and Melanie seek to empower individuals to embrace the beauty of connection to create a lasting and meaningful relationship. They hope to inspire a generation to rediscover that romance can exist within the everyday interactions of modern living.”

Haha attention seeking perhaps not. Cholesterol competing probably yes! 😉

Im looking forward very much to our hotel rendezvous. With great pleasure I will watch you gracefully move about in your sexy underwear - and delight in seeing you revel in an overdue joy of being truly desired.

I adore ( and all of the above) you too my love! But thank you for sharing with me your deep gratitude. That’s a good sign of a happy person. ☺️

Texting with Nathan and Melanie is never mundane-  be privy to the ultimate romantic couple as they tackle  the sweetness of their seeds of love, life and relationships along with the core values they share around cushioning their bruised but delightful souls.

I do feel very competitive with you around my cholesterol results - that’s why I’ve cut back to one yolk per day - I want to win on the next round of tests - reigning champion!!  

There we are in sync again - I knew it was Your Song - wow I would love to hear you sing and play that song - I’d have fallen in love with you if I had seen you in double bay playing that …. I used to frequent Double Bay quite a bit with my eastern suburbs Jewish friends . The sheaf is where we went! 
I feel every single word of that song for you my lover. 

Still no word from Erla I was just wishful thinking when I sent you the seat map … but I just sent her a nudgey little text … I might need to be more direct as worried seats will run out ! 

Bit nervous as Paul coming over tonight so we can try and work out how to split finances and bipass the lawyers for a bit … I haven’t sat down and spoken to him since he left - the weather signifies how I feel - pathetic fallacy right?

So much happened all at once. So symbolic that finally the separation of finances has been set in motion -a symbol of ending- and it happened on the same night that we were blessed with 5 days of each others company against a beautiful backdrop- a symbol of new beginnings.

The present moment feels so right, a stark contrast to the sadness and loneliness that once lingered. Both our deeply dark and challenging transformative journeys from a place of feeling stuck to rediscovering life and love again is a testament of our strength and resilience - like the regrowth that follows a wild forest blaze. I feel privileged to be able to share this chapter in our lives and we will take great pleasure in witnessing further growth and strength from within each other.  Our synchronicity goes waaaaaay beyond the symbolic separation of finances and travel go ahead  - it extends to the moment our paths crossed. It seems fated, occurring precisely when we were both so willing to welcome each other into our lives - and during a quieter phase of our busy 2023. It's as if the spiritual universe, in all its wisdom, granted us this time to unravel the layers of what makes us so uniquely special together.  Ahhh the tides of change. Thank you metaphorical moon! 🙏🏻 After we said good night to each other last night I scooped up muffin and ventured down to Elwood beach. Even with her by my side, the solitude embraced me - the darkness, the wind, and the gentle rain. An intensity of emotions overwhelmed me, and tears flowed freely. With a heart full of gratitude, I extended thanks to the special souls who have graced my life  - and it sure does feel like they are still with me.

Sending you all my love and a thousand kisses, 😘😘❤️

It’s your passion, your intensity, your willingness to embrace it that makes you so incredibly attractive to me . … it’s the passion and intensity that was knocked out of me ( partly knocked out, cause nothing can rid me of my flames, not even the family of “ shoulds and musts” that I stiflingly grew up in who scoffed at my intensity so hard until the flame in me reduced to the size of a flicker) But your flame burns so damn bright and reminds me of mine. Going for a walk in the rain at night to feel your precious souls around you, to allow your tears to fall, is sooo beautiful and reflective ..it’s exactly the sort of thing I would do before I had the responsibility of my kids . There was a beautiful cemetery in Sydney possibly near Brontë beach that I used to love to visit - on top of a cliff overlooking the ocean . I used to go there to think and cry and reflect - I must take you there one day! 

I wonder if the finding of us is also a reminder of loss for you ?  The Bittersweetness of new love also means forward motion , further from what was … closer to what is. 

Maybe just like you being in my life is helping me process the infidelity, my presence in yours allows  or even demands of you you to turn more towards your grief and look it in the eye. Maybe. 

I do believe in the synchronicity of our lives, in fate. It reminds we when I showed Michelle the video you made of your kids her response was : “he is your Beshert ! “The Hebrew word for fate. And Michelle knows me inside out so she made that statement with a knowing heart 🥰

And the synchronicity stretches backwards too - we have mostly lived close to one another -without knowing you were there my love, but you always were.  Not quite by my side yet close to me - each of us gathering wisdom until the day we could  actually meet, lock eyes. 

Sending you all my love and a billion kisses xxxx 😘😘❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️😘😘 ",,

The prospect of our reciprocal influence, with each of us contributing to each other's luminosity and balance, is a beautiful notion that I will eagerly embrace. I love your calming energy too. 🥰

Your insight into the dual nature of the emotions of push and pull is interesting -  our newfound connection pulling me forward tinged with an acknowledgment of what was left behind.  Firstly, as you already probably know, the intensity of our connection has been truly unparalleled for me. Our lingering eye gazes and insatiable desires to passionately kiss to our endless deep and meaningful writing are clear indicators of a love that is unlike anything I've ever known. In reflecting fondly on past love I can't help but feel a sense of sadness for the challenges that relationship faced - a midlife crisis on my behalf, years of infertility treatments, a newborn baby and the tragic presence of chemotherapy. Perhaps these obstacles got in the way of how deep the love could have become or maybe it could have only ever gone so deep -  I’ll never know now. Although there isn’t a huge pull of loss there anymore - as with my brother - the not knowing of what it could have truly been is how its loss can be defined. This is my grief when it comes to Romy. I have had years of therapy to work this all out. I hope that helps you understand it a bit better - I know that I’ve struggled to explain it. It’s been a jarring juxtaposition, observing and comparing these two loves. Ours in such a short period of time feels ocean deep already. I am  simply unable to fully articulate or explain it. From the moment our eyes locked across that road it was as if we already knew each other… what more can I say?  

I would love you to take me to that beautiful cemetery! In fact I can very much see us having little a romantic weekend away in Sydney’s Eastern suburbs.

I’m tempted to now send you a trillion kisses but this isn’t a competition… right? 😉 haha

Thank you for your openness and deep deep vulnerability- your  generous willingness to share the relationship you had with Romy....
So it's the not knowing that defines your grief.... maybe you actually do know more than you think-  things can only ever be what they are right now in this moment  ( Think Eckart Tolle and all those great gurus ), they cannot be a projection of anything else into the future.  Take you and I: we  are only as we are now.... we may have multiple thoughts and ruminations into the future but right now they are just stories, they dont exist....and your relationship now with Romy continues on right now as an enduring connection with her soul, -  maybe that IS what it has become and so that is the answer to your wonderings.  Maybe your wonderings of what it might have been like protect you from the sadness and reality of what it IS like....?

I too have never experienced anything even close to this, any love so deep and connected. I walk the streets of Caulfield south with Gibson and  often have tears in my eyes as I think about you. I dont have the words either...its a feeling in my body that sits so deep in my core -  a sensation I've never experienced until I met you... its love and joy and excitment and desire, its a deep respect for who you are and a gratitude that  you choose me, let me in...an absolute honour, a feeling like I want to protect and care for you. But mostly a feeling of 'knowing'... like I know you from someplace else.  Those words suck- they cannot convey what I need to say. 

As I  think I have mentioned  before, I’ve had flashes of images of seeing you as a future love that I would be meeting before I even met you - I didnt know what I was seeing at the time until I met you and realised you are the man that my mind prophetically told me about. So strange …so wonderful.

I have had many a daydream about going to Sydney with you.... I even feel that maybe one day, with you by my side, I could see my parents and feel safe enough.... 

I miss you too much - when can I see you? Xxxxxx😘😘❤️❤️",,

I agree the stories you make up in your head are interesting but not helpful in a spiritual sense. And yes when present I can connect to her soul. I love the relationship I have with her now - although sad she’s not in the physical realm. It has been jarring when asked to reflect on these two very different relationships but I’m mostly present and in a space of acceptance of what is - and wow it certainly is amazing right now.

Let’s keep going! I ❤️ it l! It’s been an important element of our growing relationship - even if we only live 2kms up each other’s roads. Haha perhaps interstate would work too! (No thanks 😉)

So… while Levi and I are both in our fetal positions, I have found comfort in thinking about your poem and psychology book “Wired for love”. 

In contemplating my relational style - the choices of Anchor, Island, or Wave… I am starting to realise that I am now an anchor, or well on the way to becoming one! Just as I am your anchor in the metaphorical ship of your poem, I've found a parallel revelation in recognizing the significant role my therapist has played - serving as a steadfast anchor at the culmination of my personal journey over 11 years. I’ve never really thought my anchor was so heavy until I met you!  Thanks for making me understand all this.

There is this great feature on the iPhone where you can take a photo of some text and copy it into a clipboard - I can show you if you don’t know about. So in the excerpt copy and pasted below:

WIRED FOR LOVE page 68-69:

… It is entirely possible to become an anchor by spending time in a close, dependent, secure relationship with another person.
That person can be a therapist, or it can be a primary romantic partner who is an anchor or close to becoming one. Spend enough time in a secure relationship, and you'll become an anchor!
Here are some supporting principles to guide you:
	1.	﻿﻿﻿Discover your partner. Using the examples presented in this chapter, find out what you may not yet know about your partner. What relationship style best describes your partner? And while you're at it, what style best describes you? As I mentioned before, please resist the temptation to use this typology as ammunition against one another. Like any powerful tool, it can inflict damage if used improperly. So use it with compassion in your relationship.
	2.	﻿﻿﻿Be unapologetically you. Our task in committed relationships is not to change or become a different person. Quite the contrary: our task is to be unapologetically ourselves. Home is not a place to feel chronically ashamed or to pretend we are someone we're not. Rather, we can be ourselves while retaining our sense of responsibility to others and to ourselves. And just as we are unapologetically ourselves, we must encourage our partner to be unapologetically himself or herself. In this way, we offer each other unconditional acceptance.Of course, being unapologetically ourselves doesn't mean we are reckless or uncaring about how we treat others, or that we can use this as an excuse to be our worst selves. For example, if your partner is unfaithful or otherwise hurtful to you, he or she can't simply say,'Tough. This is who am. Just accept it.' No. This is a time when apology is definitely in order. In fact, whenever your partner voices hurt, you need to focus less on being unapologetically yourself and more on tending to your partner's needs and concerns. Remember the first guiding principle: creating a couple bubble allows partners to keep each other safe and secure. Your mandate is to be unapologetically yourself as long as you also keep your partner safe.
	3.	Don't try to change your partner. You could say that we all change, and also that we never change. Both are true. And this is why acceptance is so important. We can and do change our attitudes, our behaviors, and even our brains over time. However, the fundamental wiring that takes place during our earliest experiences stays with us from cradle to grave. Of course, we can change this wiring in phenomenal ways through corrective relationships. Sometime these changes transform all but the last remnants of our remembered fears and injuries. But this should not be the goal of a couple's relationship. No one changes from fundamentally insecure to fundamentally secure under conditions of fear, duress, disapproval, or threat of abandon-ment. I guarantee that will not happen. Only through acceptance, high regard, respect, devotion, support, and safety will anyone gradually grow more secure.

I feel like we both are well on the way to ticking off point one discovery. We are both very good at getting to the bottom of what makes each other tick. Be unapologetically you… haha that might be tricky seeing we are both so darn polite - but we have been taking off our masks so that’s going in the right direction. And on the last point I would never try to forcibly change you. I have 100 percent acceptance of how you have come to me. I will give you all my respect, devotion, support, and safety - gradually you will grow more secure.

❤️❤️❤️😘😘😘",,

I already feel a softening of the anxiety in my body  from your steadfast presence and reliability- it might take time - and I’ve made some headway with the therapist over time too but yes still work to do .
In terms of unmasking - we are gradually getting there- compare us to our first few dates - we are much more real now. When I’m hot and cranky from cycling you shall see more lol 😂 
The word acceptance is very apt cause I can distinctly remember after our first few messages online and our first date thinking this man is lovely and if I grow to love him I will accept and love everything that is part of him - including his grief and his boy . I knew this from the very start and I have never stopped thinking about this. You are a complex  creative sensitive man  with a unique past- if I love and commit to you, I love all of you as you come- I too make a promise to nurture Nathan as is - you are so beautiful what would I want to change? I will give you all my respect, devotion, support, and safety back .
Most of all thank you for accepting that I am slightly wavish - you are so non judgmental it’s crazy . I’ve never felt so safe with someone before - thank you my sweet anchor - a true gift to be in a relationship with you .I will never take you for granted xxxxxxxxx ❤️❤️❤️❤️😘😘",,

Your influence on the time I take to prepare food is so appreciated.

Aww that is amazing! Food is life! Your salad looks so yummy! I love salad, I eat it ALL the time in summer. Plenty of ways to add protein to them as well, quinoa, feta, grated hard cheese, hard boiled egg,even seeds, The most important thing is to invest in really good extra virgin olive oil -and  not the mass produced supermarket stuff. The good stuff is very high in polyphenols. Polyphenol studies seem to be pretty encouraging in terms of prevention and treatment of cancer. Not to mention it tastes delicious with just apple cider vinegar and a bit of Himalayan rock salt to make the perfect French vinaigrette. 😋 

Fear not flustered love bird , your next voyage awaits on the 4 pm love train onwards this Thursday, the 7th. An exclusive private terrace at the Copy Cat restaurant and bar, adjacent to the Classic cinema, has been reserved for you at 7 pm. There, amidst refreshing beverages and light snacks, indulge in delightful conversations and captivating gazes as the sun gracefully sets. Please Inform your dashing train master your preferred commencement time for this romantic odyssey. Perhaps he could meet you earlier for a walk at Brighton beach car park - and he will drive you back home at the conclusion of your romantic evening.  All aboard! 🚂 😘

Im so glad we have something planned later in the week. Five days was too much last time haha. To be honest two weeks while I’m up in Sydney, until you make a cameo appearance, will come with some pining for our newfound love. Hmmm I’m not sure if it’s because you are being your adorable polite self, worried about the kids or if your wavish inclinations need to be fueled with my abiding reassurance - perhaps all of the above! So I’ll just put it out there, I think if anything five days with each other next week will solidify not unravel our blossoming relationship. In an ideal world I would ❤️❤️❤️ to have you all to myself in a mini holiday within my holiday - even if it can be only one or two nights and preferably in the eastern suburbs. That doesn’t mean I don’t want to meet your interstate friends or even be upset if we only end up having a small window together. The key takeaway here is with open arms I would love to spend as much time with your gorgeous face, brilliant mind and kind heart - I’ll really miss you while I’m up there!. 🥰 Keep this in your back pocket - the practicalities and logistics are a completely separate issue. Besides, Sydney is always up there.  It’s not far away…",,

It’s true - it’s partly because I am so polite that I was fairly timid around expressing all I want to do is be with you and yes the other part is being  hyper aware of my wavish tendencies and trying to overcompensate for that by holding back on just how ridiculously much I will pine for you when you are away .

I’m going to take Levi to the Caulfied rsl for some pasta now and will chat to you before I go to bed… that’s my update beautiful. Lots and lots and lots of love ❤️ ❤️❤️,,

Making Levi’s hair up with slick gel and pink hair spray was a bit of an ordeal but I was really triggered when I discovered that I had accidentally chucked out most of his new summer clothes in the bin with his old clothes! It’s a couple of hundred dollars worth so I can take the hit but it’s just another loss I don’t need right now - the timing wasn’t great. Lucky I have the receipts so I can go back to the shops and re order as it was a bit time consuming buying them in the first place. I might see if my therapist has some time left between now and when we go away. But overall I’ll be okay - I haven’t been close to dad for what feels like a life time but now all these other losses have bubbled up. So lucky to not be doing this on my own  - blessed to have you - and thankful I’m about to wrap up work for a month. 

Have a good day with your clients. 🙏🏻

Haha OMG I reversed my car into a wall yesterday and fucked it with a $1200 insurance claim in my 2024 pipeline and then on the Westgate bridge on the way home from Geelong someone  ran into the back of me and fucked it even more!  Now that guy has to pay $1200 to fix it.  Feels like dad is looking down on me already!

Had a much better day today. Was so much less dazed and confused. The way the body goes into shock is really weird but seems like the crazy vibrations have calmed down a lot. I’ll try and focus on more good things about my dad, attempt to stoke those conversations with mum in the coming weeks and I’ll report back to you what I discover. In the meantime I found an old ear wig that has found its way back into my heart. Dad loved this song so much and would play it over and over again. For some one as compassionate as you I thought you might like it too.

Lots and lots and lots of love. ❤️❤️❤️

I am feeling pretty exhausted today. It’s hard to look after a 7 year old and 14 year at once, so I was happy to drop Levi off at Marilyns at 2. A bit going on with all this driving around and I’m struggling a bit but hanging in there. Pepper and I just came back from the movie and we had some takeaway and now we are in bed watching tv together. I’ll start my day with a sleep in and then another busy day with driving and a bat mitzvah at Como house at 2pm - I can’t get out of this one as it’s a family friend 😔. Haha does it sound like I need a holiday much? I’m looking very much forward to Monday when I can send Levi off to school and just have some space to myself - no more gym, Ill pack, stop and rest and recharge so I’m ready for our adventure- haha yes watch out New Zealand here we come! Please drop in for a  hug and pre flight chat. 🥰

Hope you had some good mumsy time today. I’m feeling very relaxed now in Peppers company. She is just so sweet, gentle and calm. 🎉

A Monday hug and quick pop in sounds perfect amongst the priority of a rest day for you . 
I’m glad Pepper has a calming presence for you and that a sleep in is on the cards. 
Tomorrow I have managed to line up 2 catch ups with Liane and Caroline so I’m looking forward to lots of walking and cups of tea.

Bee gees, Queen, The eagles perhaps we could have a little date within our holiday and find ourselves in a dim corner again - gazing at each other lol. It’s a 20 min Uber ride there and back. Let me know if this something you might be interested and I’ll make a booking. After a few days of romantic bike riding and picturesque scenery this might be an interesting change of pace. I’m in research mode now! I’ll report back what else i find. xxx",,

I’ll do more research and we can discuss tomorrow. Haha my coffee has well and truly kicked in and Pepper is still in bed fast asleep. Sigh teenagers… 😴,,

On the fence a bit as don’t know how tired we will be but on the other hand it would be nice to have a plan … how keen are you?  Maybe just for the music but a quieter dinner beforehand?
Also do you think we should work out dinner plans for each night or just play by ear … I’m happy to make it up as we go along as who knows how tired we will be, if we might want to eat out or not etc …
And it’s not yet peak busy period so it will be easier.",,

I’ll show when you drop around tomorrow. Im happy to not pre book anything for dinner and just see where our holiday takes us too - we may need to pre book vineyard lunches though and I’ll chat to you about that tomorrow. But you are right it won’t quite be peak season so that certainly works in our favour. Not fussed about the live music on Friday - if there happens to be tickets left on the night then we may decide to go - or not.,,

It would be pretty dumb to lose such an amazing person over something that isn’t even a problem but something that enriches your life  and so that makes me happy for you . Hope you get some time to yourself - such a busy time for you. Even though I’d love to re unite before you go if it adds more pressure it’s ok not to .

plenty of vulnerable truth telling and a dash of problem solving.

And now I see,
that love means “free”.
Love is not a tight grip on a hand,
But a soft embrace of an older land.
Love isnt a grasp, a cling or a hold,
Its complex and nuanced and oh so bold!
My older heart knows so much more,
its wise grey love accepts that its sore…
it hurts and its joyous, the pain is immense,
love is for lovers and love is for friends.
love is for partners lost from before,
love needs space for me and  much more.
Cause if I let go and you love who you lost,
then sun will replace the bitter cold frost…
love her and love her and love her too,
then come back to me so I can love you 😘 ",,

Meeting Marilyn and her husband, gathering around Romy’s grave, and reflecting on her life made the day meaningful. In bringing up her memories, it struck me how many personality traits she shares with you—especially the spirituality, compassion, and conscientiousness. I can't express enough how fortunate I feel to have you in my life - a person so incredible and capable of filling the void in my heart.

After our sad gathering, we went to Mandoline on Glen Huntley Road for lunch, happy to be surrounded by the warm company of my dear older Jewish friends, Marilyn, Simmy and Silvia. Their sincere interest and enthusiasm of hearing about my holiday with you was heart warming. 

A surprise turn was when I went to pick up Levi in east Bentleigh. I unintentionally stumbled into a parenting circus. The mum took an opportunity to flee for a coffee date with friends, the unsung hero dad left to juggle his very young girls, a 1 year old vomiting cuteness, with a sleepless 3 year old in tow, and of course the two trampoline bouncing boys. I ended up befriending him and stayed around for another hour and half while we chatted about so many things as I helped him out with making the boys toast as they watched a movie.

Came home and finished off our holiday photos and sent them to you and then made everyone flathead tail fish fingers and salad.

That’s my day beautiful. Slowly starting to come back up to the surface and feel myself again. Let’s chat more in the morning. Miss you so much! 😘❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️😍",,

Today’s poem is one of my favourite by Rumi. It encourages embracing every emotion, whether positive or negative, as each can bring valuable lessons or opportunities for personal growth. I guess I was drawn to it after a few days of fluctuating emotions - that have now returned to calm waters.

THE GUEST HOUSE

This being human is a guest house.
Every morning a new arrival.
A joy, a depression, a meanness, some momentary awareness comes as an unexpected visitor.
Welcome and entertain them all!
Even if they're a crowd of sorrows, who violently sweep your house empty of its furniture, still, treat each guest honorably.
He may be clearing you out for some new delight.
The dark thought, the shame, the malice, meet them at the door laughing, and invite them in.
Be grateful for whoever comes, because each has been sent as a guide from beyond.

Can’t wait to wrap my arms around you tonight! My heart is beating faster just thinking about it.

PS on poetry have you read any Rupi Kaur  poetry? xx",,

Thanks for that timely poem . I didn’t say cause we haven’t had the opportunity but I have been filled with so many uncomfortable emotions since we parted … it’s as if I have been dysregulated ever since  and really struggling to come back to the surface. .. I feel so depressed and teary .... lots going on - our mis attunment, Paul not paying child support , visit to breast cancer surgeon sent me into a giant spin yesterday, missing you so much - So the poem is a helpful reframe on those emotions. I really can’t wait to talk with you  and share both yours and my  recent turmoil- it’s been so hard holding it all alone . 

Here is my fave poem :( striving to get to chapter 5!) 

AUTOBIOGRAPHY IN FIVE CHAPTERS 
1
I walk down the street.
There is a deep hole in the sidewalk. I fall in.
I am lost ... I am hopeless.
It isn't my fault.
It takes forever to find a way out.
II
I walk down the same street.
There is a deep hole in the sidewalk. I pretend I don't see it.
I fall in again.
I can't believe I'm in the same place. But it isn't my fault.
It still takes a long time to get out.
III
I walk down the same street.
There is a deep hole in the sidewalk. I see it is there.
I still fall in ... it’s a habit.
My eyes are open.
I know where I am.
It is my fault.
I get out immediately.
IV
I walk down the same street.
There is a deep hole in the sidewalk. I walk around it.
V
I walk down another street.

I can’t wait too to hug you x 
I haven’t read Rupi Kaur.
Glad I am seeing my psych today - really need it!",,

Things are not great here - Abi went to Paul for support which is good - she then turned up at my place at midnight last night and I just sat with her till 1 am . She totally broke down and said she can’t see how we ( her and I) can have a relationship any more - and that she will be distancing herself from me and is so disgusted at me. 
 It feels like the response I got from my mum when I was younger and wanted to explore intimacy and relationships.  
Paul was also shocked that I met “someone”online then went away overseas. He asked me to stop behaving like this so I don’t hurt Abi any further. 

They have such fixed conservative  zipped up views. I am a romantic and I don’t see anything wrong with what I did ...  the lying was wrong but  going online and going away with you  and so soon is totally in my comfort zone . 

They don’t have/ feel all the info as they don’t know “ us” so it just looks shocking to them. 

Erla ( who is a family therapist) reckons Abi is focusing on the lying but really the issue is me being in a relationship  but it’s easier to latch on to the lying piece.  
….relationships …so hard… 
I’m sure it will pass - she forgave Paul for infidelity so I think we can repair … hurts though.😞

Going to soothe myself today by shopping for clothes- I have some vouchers I haven’t used yet and it’s been a long time since I bought any clothes.  

Enjoy your day with family in the sun ☀️

Wow I’m so sorry to hear that things are not great down there.  To be honest my brain just cannot wrap itself around the negativity biases you are experiencing from Paul and Abi - and from what you have told me of your mother retrospectively. It is astonishing the level of judgement at play here 😳 - it is okay to have a porn addiction but shocking to hear that your ex wife went away romantically for 5 days with an actual real life man she met 8 weeks prior?!?The bigger concern though is your 19 year daughter’s reaction of disgust. What is so disgusting about companionship, intimacy and romance? There is the nut that you have to try and crack right there. Of course it is no surprise I feel this way as my “Big 5” assessment concluded that I am very high in openness to experience - curious and exploratory, as opposed to conservative and conventional. If it is true that the relationships in your life have conservatism baked into their challah then it is perfectly understandable that its bite will taste this way to you right now. This must be bringing so much stuff up for you. The best thing I can say to you right now is to continue to “Be you” and follow your compass to your true north. Be your own guide. Share the beauty of love, intimacy, and the significance of healthy relationships as integral elements that contribute to happiness in life. In good time your kids will see… I don’t know if this helps. You know I’m just a phone call away right? xxx ",,

I always knew they were critical and judgemental of me but this time round i feel pretty proud of myself for finding my way back to me and living my truth even if I did hurt a and z. … we ( Abi and I ) just had a great conversation around intimacy and Shame - she may have received these messages from her all girls school , possibly Paul and I and our hopeless relationship and just the community in general - her thinking is so black and white : you are either conservative or out there risking everything - helped her realise there are shades of grey … and we don’t have to have the same opinions- just try accept each other as we come - although I did say how I want to role model to her a warm loving real relationship as that’s what I wish so much for her to have too. ….Ah there can be no growth without suffering  right?

Very close to Abi
Close to me!
It is a highly sort after villa/unit - sound investment.
South facing so cooler in Summer
Appears to be quite bright with lots of windows and bathroom skylight 
Made out of brick
Well equipped kitchen with an island bench in an open plan space/entertaining
Space for two dogs and  outdoor areas for them
Tiling in living areas easy to clean 
Walking  distance to Gardenvale
Walk in  laundry
Seperate home office for admin and private zoom client sessions
Feels spacious with open plan deck
Has a bath.
Low maintenance property 
Good distance from your bedroom and Zs
In your budget
A shed to store random stuff

Cons

Facade unattractive 
South facing - not as much light in winter and requires more energy to keep warm but then again it’s well insulated by brick
A lot of concrete, brick and fake grass. Does it feel like you are feeling connected to nature? Could be solved with some great big pot plants on the balcony.

Things to consider

Will it be easy to get the car in an out of the carport ?
Do you feel like you have adequate privacy?
Will the artificial grass drain adequately so the dog piss smell doesn’t become pungent?
Body corp costs? 
Can you chat to the neighbours and see what they are like?
Does it have enough storage space? Where does the vacuum cleaner go?

Omg today was an incredible day of repair  and healing between Abi and I - everything is going to be ok!!  I am so proud of her resilience and ability to accept - and understand as always is the case - I hurt her AND I was trying not to hurt her - always AND/BOTH . 
Lots of tears and hugs - I think she will accept you one day . We have set up a ritual weekly dinner together yay . 

In other news which I actually see as normal and progress in Zach’s development- he bought a new phone secretly and had it delivered to Abi s place - I was concerned about his lack of pushing boundaries / he was waaay too compliant - so here it is - getting his teenage needs met -just had a good old conversation around porn  and communicating what he needs rather than keeping secrets ( of course he called me a hypocrite!) even got tears from Zach and a compromise to set phone to everything up to but not including R rated. . I am actually proud of him for this …  I think that my seeking out to have a relationship with you has modelled to Zach that it’s ok to go ahead and meet your needs.  ( more freedom online) ah what a day ! No pain, no gain! Thank you for coming into my life - it is having a major ripple effect on my kids in a way that was totally needed for some big life lessons. 
Just topped it off with a movie at the classic  with my extended Jewish family, One Life, that had me crying 😭 all the way through . 
Time for a long walk in the rain.
Lots of love ❤️ xx",,

But I want that real full moon black magic and it takes two”

Here you go , I’ve responded with three verses.

My cauldron stirs, anticipation aglow,
For the flame of your return, love's afterglow.
For now, I’m loving your echoes across distance and land,
A connection woven by an unseen hand.

A symphony of waiting, notes in the air,
Our love's melody, a tune so rare.
And your wondering, do I miss you… in return?
Do the stars above in the night sky burn?

The puzzle of us, falling into its place,
A mosaic of love, like a tender embrace.
Soon, our hearts will dance, a radiant light,
As daybreak emerges from the still of the night.

Things have been pretty festive up here and going well. I’ve done a lot of cooking and now mum and Levi have crashed and hit the inevitable Christmas come down phase of the day. 😂 

That is so great to hear you are making some healing inroads with Abi. It must be a big change for her, that is, sharing you with someone for the very first time in over 14 years. Just like Carl Jung once said: 'Everything that irritates us about others can lead us to an understanding of ourselves.' I’m sure this experience will be personal growth for her.

Go Zack! - tip toeing around his mummas back. Break down those walls! It was a pleasure to come into your life, I’m glad it is enriching yours in more ways than one! 😍

I love the sound of Melbournes rainy Christmas. Is the weather suiting your mood? Levi and I are going to hit the beach now. It is so good to be able to do that, clear the head and fall into nature. 😘❤️",,

It has been refreshing to escape from the cozy but humid confines of mums tiny Avalon Beach apartment to the open and spacious surroundings of Bowral.  We arrived to a gentle storm and cool rain - a serene and soothing atmosphere. Anneka's house is absolutely charming, set on an expansive acre property with a beautiful garden that attracts a variety of birds. I’ll send some photos tomorrow 🤩

I bought Levi a Nintendo switch game console and we have been taking turns playing that on the couch while mum and Anneka cook in the kitchen - and also while I write this to you ✍️ . It is nice to be able to relax a bit after a busy time cooking on Christmas Day - mum doesn’t do much she likes being lazy.

I am starting to miss my own space - my mother has an intense extroverted energy about her that my introversion finds depleting. This morning I booked a beach view hotel for Levi and I to chill out together on Friday night in Manly - this is how I will recharge. I miss just having time alone with him as his energy is gentle and calming - like yours 🥰. Manly is a great place for kids too - we can pop on a ferry and go anywhere if we please. I also can’t wait to recharge with you. I was very pleased that you accepted my offer to be your chauffeur on Sunday. And then I eagerly wait our full day today together on Monday/Tuesday 🥰

I spoke to mum in the car on the 2 hour drive to Bowral today - btw she loved “I am woman”. I told her we have to have a ceremony for dad before we go. I know I will need it for closure. It seemed to take some convincing with her and then she revealed that she is living in denial that he has died and she  is worried that  she is going to break down. It all feels a bit weird at the moment - like nothing happened?! I think I’ve managed to convince her that we can just have a simple thing on Avalon beach heads where we release dad’s ashes - ashes she told me she asked the funeral home to deliver in the mail! 🤷‍♂️ Judaism is so much more efficient- Romy was buried with a funeral the next day! 

Okay better get back to my family and friend. Missing you so much. Our playlist on the drive here brought me back to so many wonderful memories of us - can’t wait to create many more!

Love you! 😘❤️",,

Thank you soooo much for taking the time to tell me about your holiday and how you are feeling - it really helped me feel closer to you.  .. and you took the time to do this even though you are feeling that your energy is a bit depleted - it’s been a long time non stop with your mum -  I think that’s pretty challenging- and sweet man you are such a generous and loving giver - you give so much of yourself to everyone- I really hope I can help you slow down a bit, care for you, when I see you - that’s a great idea you booked a night away for you and Levi in Manly. 

Thanks for sharing    about your dad too … I understand it would be important to get some closure for you . 

I was sooo excited when you offered to pick me up - thank you so much! One less day to wait to see you x 

Speaking of being drained - just had another big rupture with Abi - she asked if you will be in Sydney - I said yes and she took that as me lying again as I didn’t initiate telling her - she was angry she had to ask . Literally 2 hrs of her berating me - but as always got there in the end with lots of good communication and just sitting with her big feelings. Ah bed at last x

Love you sooo much ❤️",,

As I was walking and reflecting this morning I realised how safe and secure you make me feel - you are such an amazing man and I just can’t believe I have found you - I am so lucky. 
I realised that I don’t at all feel triggered in any way any more around the fact that your friends are women .  I don’t know what happened in me - maybe just more and more I see how reliable you are and I just trust you . 
Anyway you have my complete support in those friendships.

Today was Action Therapy day  for me! ..looks like all the maintenance problems are mine to deal with so rather than fret about them I set myself to work - back and forth to the pool shop to problem solve with the technicians why this pool is green , came up with creative way to temporarily fix the fence , did the weeding,  put 8 items up on Gumtree, moved furniture that isn’t needed so stylists can come in and do their work pre selling of house … I am woman! If you listen closely that sound you hear all the way in Bowral is me roaring ha ha !

What a great buy 👏 Just as I thought it’s a solid property with minor defects. Your well earned negotiation savings will help out with the required repairs and go towards the stamp duty. 

Missing you like crazy  too! 

Aside, for some reason, Levi has been pushing his boundaries on this holiday compared to last summer holiday, and I’ve been seeing a little bit of pushback from him - which has been also depleting . Mum is looking after him this afternoon back at the beach apartment and I am now off for a swim. Yay beach life! I think now that I’ve got the Bowral trip the way now  I’m a bit more relaxed myself. The only driving I’m looking forward to now is my trip to the airport on Sunday morning!

Ah yes holidays with young kids - they are not easy - sometimes I think we romanticise what they should look like compared to the reality - which really is very normal - that is, overtired, hangry, boundary pushing kids! ..but know that all your efforts are laying the foundation for Levi   feeling so loved by you- he will only remember the good times and how he feels with you. 
Remember pushing boundaries is a positive developmental sign ( although it’s not easy as a parent to be on the receiving end of it) - it means he is trying to get his needs met and feels safe enough with you to do it . As uncomfortable as it is, Levi is doing exactly what he should be doing. AND it’s really hard for you as a sole parent to be navigating this. But I’m here for you always to help you navigate 🧭 you are my anchor, I can be your compass ❤️
Hope some alone time has refilled your cup - parenting is exhausting but you are an amazingly loving and resilient dad and all your kids are so lucky to have you .

Thanks so much for this validation and expert advice - my sexy registered psychologist. I had a disagreement with my mother over parenting styles just after I sent you my text -so your timing was perfect! She was telling me that Levi needs to learn how to respect me and I was saying nah he’s just been up late the last three nights, Christmas time has been over stimulating  and he’s out of his routine. I was worried she was going to get the wooden spoon out next! I guess that might explain the 11 years of therapy I’ve had to go through. Ha ha 😉 Anyway, all those years of investment are paying off in dividends, I’m mr anchorman now - she’s hard work with her oldschool ways, neuroticism and lacking in empathy but it just doesn’t mess with me like it used to. Old me would have burnt rubber back to Melbourne right now 🏝️ 😉 
(Silver lining  I’d get to see you sooner though haha 🥰) Sigh… but yeah it’s been a strange summer holiday this one with strong mixed emotions - loss, dad died just before it and love, I’ve fallen for this amazing Melbourne chick. A new beginning and an ending all happening at the same time.

But back to Levi, he does  need me to get him back into his normal nighttime bedtime routine. Which suits me fine as don’t mind going to bed early and getting up early on holiday. Christmas, can be such a crazy time - thank fuck that’s over lol. Looking forward to the routine again myself.

I’m feeling  more relaxed after an afternoon at the beach followed by some time lifting weights at the gym. I’ve given muffin a bath and we are just chilling at the beach as I write this ✍️ so she can dry - it’s still quite warm.

Love you too! 😘",,

Omg I may not have felt confident  enough to buy that place without your support.

You too are impressive in the way you have handled your emotions around your mum- it’s your turn to be the parent, you know what Levi needs best and everything else is just background noise - just smile and nod , no need to justify or defend yourself - you know that Levi’s behaviour isn’t bad- it’s just a form of communication- and you worked out that he needs his routine back ! Omg if your mum heard Abi the other night calling me a mentally ill imbecile, a lying cunt … fuuuck - I realised I  have come a long way as I no longer react to that when before I used to. With no reaction from me she is left with the bitter taste of the words in her mouth and she corrected herself by apologising profusely and feeling terrible for not controlling her anger - ta- da no wooden spoon needed! 

The lack of empathy sounds really hard - especially for my fellow sensitive INFJ ….

Christmas time sounds hard work from what I can see - today most of my clients needed to debrief about their Christmas- so you are not alone!  Maybe you should actually consider converting to Judaism lol - that would excuse you from the Christmas stress hmm but Jews have a frickin festival  or ten to celebrate around almost every corner - so that might not work either for you! 

Yes what a summer you have had - loss and love - so mixed . I’m so glad we found love together and I just love and care for you so much that I  hope I can be a soft  slower paced quieter place for you to land when the loss part comes up for you. 

I’m glad the beach and gym helped you - always exercise and nature - the best therapy ! 

Sending you the biggest frickin hug 🤗 ever - soon it will be Sunday and    we will  be together.

Keep leaning on me beautiful man, just call ( or maybe text😉) me when you need a friend, cause you are my best friend.

Hi most beautiful,

 I unfortunately don’t have any wedding photos of me to share. My ex wife probably has them. Anyway I’m much sexier now - age has been kind to me.

I’m sharing this photo of mum and dad instead, when they were young and in love - taken before I was born.

Anyway I’ve had in the back of my mind for a while now that mum wasn’t going to make it back to Melbourne with us.  It's been strange that she hasn't shown any emotion related to grief since my dad's passing - and after 56 years together. As Levi and I checked into our charming hotel room, I received a text from her. She expressed feeling shaken and emotional, explaining that she needs to be on her own and can't join us in our return to Melbourne next week - Dad’s ashes finally arrived in the mail when we were on a bus to Manly. Not surprisingly, this was a huge relief for me , given our clashing personalities and the tendency to deplete each other over time. 

Understanding that my mother needs this time to grieve, I've suggested she come down and stay with us in February or March - when she feels ready. Despite her difficulty empathising with others, especially in times like this, I'm persistently trying to convince her to have some form of ceremony. Closure is important for both of us. I'm hoping we can venture to the Avalon beach headland for a picnic, creating an opportunity to talk about my dad - or something?!. The frustration persists, but I'm determined to make strides.

Decided to shift my return drive to Thursday next week - again it feels like a significant weight has been lifted off my shoulders with this change of plans. Im feeling quite homesick too.

But back to the present, Levi and I have fallen in love with the hotel we're in tonight – an old art deco room with a balcony view overlooking the Esplanade on Manly Beach. Currently, Levi's wrapped up in a Netflix kids movie, and once he's done, we're heading to Shelly Beach for a relaxing swim.

I really can’t wait to see you! 😢 🥰",IMG_1529.jpeg,Image

That’s such a lovely memory of your parents! Your dad looks so much like the larrikin photo of you - you have so much of him in you…. 

Age has been kind to you but I reckon I would have fallen for you had I met you at any age my love . There is so much more to you than your incredible sexy ness - it’s also your sweetness, the larrikin part, your beautiful, funny and deep mind, your sensitivity and one of a kind- ness. 

I’m sorry to hear your mum is struggling and won’t be able to come back to Melbourne- your poor mum not able to access her sadness but maybe it will come when she is alone . I’m more worried about you though and your need for some closure possibly not being met .. wish I could give you a big hug right now- it’s hard being so far away from you when it sounds like there is a bit going on.🤗🤗🤗 it’s hard seeing that your mum struggles to validate your needs as a son who has lost his dad😞

… yes it sounds like a relief for you though that you will have your own space back but I’m guessing it will be tricky now to juggle school holidays and returning to work … 😓 if I could help in any way… 

Your art deco hotel escape sounds like the perfect way to end your week… hope you and Levi enjoyed your swim  together.

I really can’t wait to see you too 😢🥰
I just wanna be close to you .",,

Things are going okay - our mini-break to Manly was a breath of fresh air. Amidst the bustling surfers paradise/Las Vegas comparable crowds, we found solace in our cozy hotel retreat. Basking in the luxury of our own space, the highlight of our getaway was the magical summer rainstorm that embraced us. With today’s sunny weather, we entrusted our luggage to concierge before navigating through the sea of beachgoers to Manly Fairy Bower sea pool, where the juxtaposition of calm waters and the bustling coastal ambiance created a delightful escape from the ordinary.

…Or a delightful escape from my mother lol. I was a bit anxious about what I was going to come back to today. When we arrived she was in bed and hadn’t eaten all day. I just gave her some grilled salmon and salad and she ate that. She said she went into a bit of shock after picking up the ashes from the post office. Anyway I’m still super relieved that she isn’t coming back with us. I sure am grateful that she has helped out with Levi since the 12th December but I think she has reached her limit now.  It’s understandable that she has to tap into her grief now but also understandable that I have a limit too with her intense extroversion and narcissistic personality - everything is always about her 🤯. There are other ways I can call on support to get through the rest of the school holidays - I’ve done it before and I’ll do it again. And thank god i now have my beautiful empath Melanie in my life now. Sigh… how great has it been to have my feelings heard by you. 🥰 No trying to fix problems or dismiss them. Just listen and acknowledge. Thank you 🙏🏻",,

Your 
kindness, acceptance and maturity shines through in your text - your mum is a challenge for you AND you provide loving care to her by making sure she has eaten, you are grateful for her support AND you need a break …. The ambivalence of the relationship is stark and you live with acceptance of her limitations …. You are amazing! 
It’s interesting you use the word narcissistic as I have wondered for years if my mum is a narcissist- I can’t say I know what it’s like for you but I have some understanding from my own mum what it’s like to have a parent who puts themselves first and has very little empathy.

Every time I see you it just gets better and better when it doesn’t even seem possible as it already feels perfect . It gets deeper, more real, more comfortable, more close and at times more funny ! You are so  incredibly precious to me - I just want to care for you forever, wrap my arms around you and never let you go.  
You are so authentic and real and true in a world where most are none of those things - this authenticity and courage to feel is what I find so attractive in you. 
Thank you for trusting me with your tears, your melancholy and your heart. Thanks for the cosy Italian meal together,  the calm grounded driving around together and the endless hugs in bed. 
I still can’t understand this crazy chemistry, deep intuitive understanding between us - may the invisible string keep us connected until we meet again. 
I love you  truely madly deeply❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️😘😘😘😘😘😘",,
Melanie,2024-01-02 19:40:09,,,,iMessage,Outgoing,,,Delivered,,,"Dearest most beautiful Melanie, oh boy I feel so strongly the same. The depth of our connection, rooted in the rarity of our shared personality types, has brought an unparalleled sense of fulfilment. Finally, I've found someone who not only understands but resonates with the essence of who I am.

Our conversations, laden with profound thoughts, feelings, and ideas, feel nothing less than authentic. The way we effortlessly navigate through the intricacies of our emotions and needs reflects a level of understanding and empathy that is truly extraordinary to me.

I love our shared vision for a future that aligns seamlessly with our ideals. Our imaginative (or hypothetical) discussions as we walked around Centennial Park, fuelled by creativity and a touch of idealism, painted a vivid picture of what could be for us– a future that feels not just possible, but destined.

Reading your words fills my heart with an indescribable warmth and joy. Thank you for being the most beautiful presence in my life, a source of endless happiness that seems to grow with every shared moment.  Our Sydney  moments, from the cozy Italian meal to the calm drives and the endless hugs in bed, are etched in my memory as treasures.Your appreciation for my authenticity and courage to feel in a world that often lacks those qualities is a gift beyond measure. To know that you see and value the real me is truly humbling. I had a premonition that a day would come when you'd witness the vulnerable depths of my soul. As I drove from Avalon Beach to the hotel, I grappled with attempting to cast off the heavy shroud of melancholy that clung to me. Despite my earnest efforts, it stubbornly lingered, and in a moment of vulnerability, I chose to surrender to it, allowing you a poignant glimpse into the most intimate corners of my being. To my great surprise, I've discovered a newfound ease and freedom in your presence. Now that I've unburdened a significant part of my sadness in the last 24 hours, I can already feel a remarkable improvement in my well-being tonight. It's a testament to the healing power that sharing one's true self with someone as understanding and supportive as YOU can bring. 🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻

The chemistry we share, that deep intuitive understanding, does feel like a cosmic force guiding us. May the invisible string that binds us continue to pull us close until we meet again. I cherish you, Melanie Strang, truly, madly, and deeply.❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️😘😘😘😘😘😘

Ps As predicted the inevitable Mum meltdown arrived when I got back - She berated me - apparently I don’t support her enough and me being a sole parent isn’t a big deal because she had to look after me and my brother on her own while Dad did nothing and she’s going to sell the Avalon beach apartment, spend it all and leave what’s left to the animals lol. I mean is just narcissist mad lady talk - she can be really nasty when she gets angry. Of course this came 1 hour after I told her we are going home tomorrow night so can I only guess it’s all emotions connected to that. Im not angry with her and remained calm- I’m just tired and very homesick now.  She went for a beach walk and came back and seems to have cooled down. 

All is good. I love you…",,

I only want the true version of you sweet man and it is our destiny to have met and for you and I to be truely seen and heard by each other ... we have both waited half a century for this place where we can belong . I don’t want the pretend happy, busy, version of you - I’m still in total awe that you allowed me to glimpse into your deepest most intimate corner of your being - don’t ever stop - I love knowing you truely, deeply. I am alive with joy to be able to connect to this part of you - I always felt your sadness and it’s such an honour to be allowed in.
“Everybody hurts “ but now you are not alone. No more aloneness for us both - that’s over  now . 

“When the bones are good, the rest don't matter
Yeah, the paint could peel, the glass could shatter
Let it break, 'cause you and I remain the same
When there ain't a crack in the foundation
Baby, I know any storm we're facing will
Blow right over while we stay put
The house don't fall when the bones are good”

https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=gvPMVKUI9go

It’s you and me now sweet Nathan - we are the bones and we are the foundation. Together we can and will be a force to get through anything . Including mean mums ! Our love is stronger than bones, our support of each other means any pain is halved, is cushioned , is held. The bones are good. .. more than good! 

Good luck on your final day - please drive home safely cause I’ll be waiting for you to return so i can keep building this beautiful relationship with the love of my life. I Love you  T,M,D 😘 ❤️ xx",,

Sorry I was a bit not myself and not that chatty on the phone last night - I was feeling really really teary low and sad and worried about so many things yesterday and most of all that yuck untethered disconnected feeling I get .. I’m sure you picked it up. It just seems to have all hit me at once - that house-buying - resilient version of me just disappeared yesterday.  I think I’ve been running on adrenaline and now it’s catching up. 
I’m sorry I didn’t respond much to your texts - I just wanted to say that you are amazing in so many ways - the way you pick yourself up from being hurt/ disappointed by your mum ( and compassionately put her behaviour down to grief) and invite in your family in Melbourne with your ever present generosity. The way you feel grateful for your home and people and how you surround Levi with so much love and support. You are so resilient! 
Thanks for making an effort sending me photos and texts. - I really appreciated that.
Aah real life - real parts of me - can’t be your chirpy upbeat date at all times Lol .  I’ll get there - just really have to get out of this house and I never want to speak to a lawyer again ! I’m even thinking if I need to rent an Airbnb anyway to cover the gap between settlements I could do this sooner rather than later if the people that buy this place want in sooner . So maybe I just need to be here till end of March . 
Also I’m going to try change the small surprise thing I organised for tomorrow to tonight as that will probably work better .
Can’t wait to see you soon xxx😘",,

Would have much preferred if last nights phone call was of tears and connection - than chirpy and giggles.  This disconnected side to you that pops up every now and again is something I’m just learning about you. It’s a nut I am determined to crack!

I still think you are so resilient and at the same time think it’s totally normal to feel the sadness of what you are going through.  Divorce sucks!

Sounds like a co parenting relationship with Paul will be like pushing shit up hill given that there is years of history of bad communication, vagueness and unreliability. I’ve sent plenty of angry texts to my ex in the first year after separation. It is too easy to fire them off in the moment. She would never fire angry ones back and it left me feeling awful. Your kids have one foot in the young adult camp so I guess at least their co parenting needs won’t be as involved as if they were little kids.

Wish I could  have invited you to my family dinner last night but looking forward to when we level up to that stage in our relationship. Perhaps let’s move forward with some new steps. Marilyn is dying to meet you - one and one over coffee soon? And of course let’s plan when to have you around for dinner with Levi.

I’m having a lazy day today of inactivity in air conditioning. Followed by YOU! Can’t wait… 🥰",,

Intellectually I know the importance of being vulnerable but you are right I don’t find it easy cause I’ve spent years packing it all away - I just realised this now. It’s much easier for me to look after you … the concept of a partner looking after me seems so foreign.  I can do it a bit with my friends but I have come from a place where I had no expectation that my partner would be there… need to work on this cause I’m just so used to crying alone. Also last night you were so happy (and I was happy for you )and accomplished to have your Melbourne family , it didn’t feel like the right time for my sadness to appear lol .I still was angry too and hadn’t gotten to the bottom of it last night yet.
I’m interested if you felt my disconnect? How it impacted you? 
If you do pick up I seem disconnected at times can you call me out on it? It might help me be more honest with you as to how I’m feeling. 🙏🏻 

That’s very sweet Marilyn wants to meet.  There is a big part of me that wants to step this up and be a bigger part of your life and I have to admit there is also a part that is scared and possibly not quite ready too.  Mainly cause I have so much stress right now and even though being a bigger part of your life would be so lovely there is also  stress that comes with anything new. Lots to talk about and I appreciate your intentions in bringing this up right now🙏🏻

Thanks for your support 🥰😘

In breaking news my Scottish mum has defrosted from her icy winter 🥶 and responded to my text from when we got back. Yay relationship back on track and back to sending her cute selfies of Levi and myself again. 

No expectations on how next steps progress. Sounds like now is currently not a good time.

Hey not fair that I bare all sadness and vulnerability to you for the first time and now you are holding yours all to yourself! 😉 Although I did see the anger you are carrying towards your mum when she sent her New Year’s Day text. 😡. Up until then I thought your anger was like the  Loch Ness monster – rare, mysterious, and wondered if it truly exists! Haha

Abi is going to the classic tonight from 5.30 till 8.30 - I told her you live next door and now I’m under strict instructions to steer clear of Glen Huntley rd this evening as she “does not want anything to do my my new life .”  Aah she just needs time - I’m sure it will be ok eventually. 
Off to have a swim - may as well embrace this big house from my past life where I can 😀
Let me know what time suits you today- happy to start at your place as long as we vacate the suburb by 5 ish.

There is something I wasn’t completely honest about as I felt too ashamed to admit it ( cheesecake anyone? Lol)  I feel guilty about that and am really committed to doing this relationship with vulnerability rather than suppression so need to tell you …you said you thought I was angry towards you on Friday night and I denied it as I knew it related to my wavish tendencies and didn’t want to be vulnerable - I did feel some anger towards you on Friday and at the same time felt I understood your needs as well so that’s why I didn’t share it as I worked through it ( maybe not enough though cause you felt it) . I understood and expected you needed a day to unwind and be in your nest and do all your admin AND although you were not aware, in the context of having a bad day, felt I hadn’t heard from you in a while and resented this. 
I think had I been in a better mood, not been stressed by Paul stuff etc I wouldn’t have felt angry- it was just  the mood I was in which you couldn’t have known, meant I felt really alone and so not hearing from you in a while exacerbated that ... anyway of course what you felt ( my anger) was correct - cause you are a kick ass emotional barometer ! 

But underneath that anger really was the feeling of missing you 😢 that’s really what it was about .

 I could have just texted you and said I miss you … I think we identified this as a potential challenge when we did our psychometric testing that cause I’m lower on assertiveness - I m less likely to speak up to get my needs met  and then I feel resentful .

Sorry I wasn’t able to talk about it till now . .. thank you for being patient while I learn again how to be in a relationship after such a long time . 

….got there in the end though . Love you lots!  And hope you are having a good day.❤️😘xx

Ps I feel a lot better today - great early walk and coffee with the dog , now I’m even feeling motivated to make a vegetarian quiche 😘☺️😀

I don’t want you to think that I have just written off your emotions on Friday - despite my need to put my oxygen mask on first (and Levis), for just a little bit longer, I just wanted to acknowledge your resentment and anger that you weren’t getting your needs met, in your time of need, after a week of giving so much to me. As you know I have a weekend free this weekend and really want to do something special for YOU. Let me have a good think and Ill come up with some ideas…",,

It was an honour to be let into your world and in no way a burden- it is what I’ve always looked for in a man and didn’t think it was possible till now - a man who will let me in to his inner world - so thank you 🙏🏻 truely wonderful you are x

You were not to know how sad I felt on Friday via one pissy little text vaguely mentioning a few negative things - it was my responsibility to get my needs met not yours to guess them .  I was also mindful it wasn’t a good time for you as you just got back . 
I really appreciate you revisiting this Friday thing though as it makes me feel so cared for that you bothered enough to come back to it - although I appreciated you waving my anger off at the time, it did feel incomplete.

So now that it’s a better time , I really should practice letting you in a bit more.. I’m worried about how low my mood is and that I can’t engage with anything much - I usually am struck with anxiety only so this sudden drop in mood is quite disturbing. It’s a combo of suddenly having no more adrenaline driven things like buying houses and going on holidays  with amazing online lovers 😜and feeling the pain of my kids distancing from me and so sad for a and z and what they are going through . .. only just feeling it now for first time.
I was already isolated but now feel even more so with Abi not being around as much…
I think I need to find a way to keep going with my psychologist- will look into this. I will be ok - I have avoided feeling this till now - it had to arrive at some point .

Thanks for trying so hard - can’t wait to spend time with you - just being with you is enough❤️

Your text has already helped me as I am freely crying in response to it which feels like a release.

Tomorrow …. Can’t wait! Xx 😘😘",,

It also seems that our Sydney holiday has even deepened our connection as well. I’ve noticed that now I have succumb completely to my raw emotions around you only day’s later you are starting to do the same.

I’m sorry to hear about the challenges you’re facing right now, especially with your mood and anxiety. It’s difficult to fully comprehend the depth of what you’re going through, and the impact it must be having on your kids. Your situation kind of reminds me of a personal experience when I was around 18-19 years old. I saw my dad lose everything, including our family home. That loss, and the subsequent uprooting, left a deep impact on me, especially as someone sensitive to change at the time.

I agree that continuing to see your psychologist is a very wise decision. It might also be helpful to try journaling. This could allow you to track your emotions over time, giving you insights into how they evolve and change.

Please remember, sweet beautiful Melanie, I am here for you through all of this. I want to be your steadfast support, your anchor in these turbulent times. You mean so much to me, and I love you deeply. We’ll navigate these waves together. ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️

I finally had the chance to bake that caramelized onion and goat's feta tart tonight. How about you join me for dinner tomorrow evening? We can enjoy a cozy meal together and then just see where the evening takes us. Maybe a drive to the North Road car park for some quiet time, or perhaps catching a movie next door? One thing's for certain: you're in for a big, warm cuddle. Cant wait either! Xx 😘😘",,

It means the world to me to have your understanding and empathy during this challenging time. Your words bring me comfort and strength, and I'm truly grateful for your unwavering support and love.

I'll keep in touch and reach out whenever I need to talk. Your thoughtfulness is a bright spot in my day ☀️ 

Last night's combination of over-the-counter melatonin and magnesium really did the trick, gifting me with  9 hours of sleep and I have woken up to some much-needed quiet time,. On a lighter note, after yesterday’s “leg day” at the gym, my butt muscles are staging a protest as well! It’s like they’ve taken a page out of my mother’s book on holding grievances. Haha 😬

Hey would you be interested in joining me for a special date night on Tuesday, April 23, 2024, at 7:30 PM? The event takes place at the Melbourne Recital Centre, specifically in the acoustically splendid Elizabeth Murdoch Hall. We’ll be experiencing a live performance by Beth Orton, the acclaimed English singer-songwriter renowned for her innovative fusion of folk and electronic music. Her concerts are celebrated for their intimate and captivating ambiance, which truly allows the audience to immerse themselves in her music. I believe you would really enjoy the distinctive and heartfelt atmosphere of a Beth Orton concert. It promises to be a memorable evening!

Did you sleep ok? Sweet lovely man I’m so sad for the little boy in you and your adult self that tries so hard for little return and hurt - wish I could carry some of your anger/ pain… in the short time I’ve known you I can see already how much Romy’s family and Levi adore you . .. and you know I care and adore you too .  You are so beautiful and don’t deserve this. Just keep turning towards the people who care for you… Thinking of you and here with you always- wishing I could melt your troubles like a lemon drop .

I don’t think I can make going away work sorry - it’s prob not the right time anyway … but instead I got Saturday - you just need to be in my car as I whisk you away in my bubble to sand and sea, if you are up for it a walk and  great coffee.  Then after a small break to attend to parenting duties I will make sure you are fed with a really easy casual picnic dinner idea on my picnic rug this time, in garden settings then take you home to your safe cosy place . 
You need think of nothing, - just be and let me care for you .

Ps If you change your mind and need a hug at any time tonight  even just for 10 minutes I’m around. .. just say the word and I’ll be there. You don’t have to do this grief and sadness alone  … I respect your need to be alone though if that’s what you need right now but just wanted to offer in case…

I had an interesting experience today. Levi and I ventured to a French music festival at the picturesque Werribee Mansion in Victoria. It was quite the journey getting there via public transport from where we live, but it turned into an adventure of its own.

The festival had a unique vibe. While the music wasn't entirely to my taste, the lush gardens of the mansion provided a stunning backdrop. The highlight, undoubtedly, were the French food stalls scattered around the venue. Despite the queues, the wait was worth it - the flavors were authentically French 😋.

I took a bit of a relaxed approach with Levi, giving him some independence to play. I wrote my number on his arm for safety and let him enjoy the children's section with his friend Bella. They had a blast with the face painting and were utterly fascinated by the mime artist. It's always a joy to see children so happily engaged.

My friend Lara and I managed to steal a few moments of chat amongst it all. She was telling me about a 3 week trip to Thailand she has planned for her and Bella in March - and I nodded politely with pretend enthusiasm as I imagined it as my own worst nightmare haha.

Reflecting on the day, it was quite full-on, and I'm now relishing the peace of being back home after a quick escape in an Uber. It's nice to unwind and look forward to an early night. The day stood in stark contrast to the effortless, deep, and intimate moments we share. I found myself appreciating our times together even more.

Hope you had a good day getting on top of house stuff. I really miss you and can’t wait to see you again soon. xxx

Love you so much! 🥰🥰🥰",,

Not as embarrassing as having a Little Mix song on my playlist though ! 

Thank you so much for taking the time to share your day with me - I can see the effort you are going to to help me feel comfortable with your friendship with Lara ( it really helps!) - I am really ok - I feel so safe and secure with you and only want what is best for you as I love you so much. It’s a combination of feeling safe with you ( and loved) and just making a  firm and deliberate decision to not let my past affect what we have - it’s just too precious. I feel so different ( more in control) to when I had that meltdown - it’s more a feeling of - I love and trust you and want the best for you, so support your friendships because of that .
You are literally re wiring my brain … thank you ! 

I’m so glad Levi enjoyed his freedom and the entertainment. .. especially cause sometimes these events can be a bit overwhelming but sounds like it was a positive experience for him.

I got lots done today - made another huge pile of hard rubbish in the garage ( pronounced gaa-rage! ), 
packed some more things into boxes, stashed away stuff so that it’s getting closer to looking like a show home that nobody lives in lol 😂 I don’t mind the process at all .

I miss you so much too - I keep reflecting on our day/ evening yesterday - every time we just get deeper and closer …

I was at the gym this morning and completed another high intensity training session and sweated bullets again. 😓 it was so much fun. I love it, the uplifting rhythmic music and the social connection with people I know at the gym.

I was going to take Levi into the cbd office today and work with him by my side with his iPad but then Marilyn called and said he’s got a play date lined up so I dropped him off there at 9:30 and got lots of good work done. 

I’m just walking down to the beach now with muffin before it gets too hot and then we’ll go back and spend the afternoon in the cool air con doing a bit more work. Perhaps might head to the beach again tonight I’m not sure …

Good job going for a jog! The weather was so gorgeous this morning. After over a week back home and the clearing out of emotions in my guesthouse I’m really getting back into the swing of a new lease of summer life -  much happier again.

Miss you too xx😘😎",,

Rest assure I am working on myself through trying to strengthen my social connections  and personal interests as an individual and through therapy.

I hear you are committed to this relationship and I also hear/ feel a little ambivalence from you ( I could be totally wrong cause it’s via text so maybe we should have a phone chat tonight to clarify ) it’s the first time I’ve felt this from your end - my understanding is it’s a normal phase to go through in a developing or committed relationship… if that’s what is happening.  I remember you said you felt ambivalence with Romy and I remember thinking that’s normal in most relationships.
I guess it’s a challenge for us as you say in our early stages - and let’s use it as a learning opportunity. 
I’m confident my mood will improve as it always does - ( running again today tells me I just have to up the exercise  to help) I can see it could create questions in your mind and also  on my end it has felt a little like perhaps you have pulled away when I need ( expressing a need here!) you to turn towards me more at this time  as my mood is lower eg check in that I’m ok like I did for you when you were upset at your mum ( again I could be wrong/ misinterpreting but that’s what it feels like, maybe you are just busy juggling)  if that’s what is happening ( turning away a bit) I’m curious why…? I worry there is an expectation to find a partner with more resilience , less stresses…
The reality is I do come with a current divorce , estranged parents and two very rigid children - lol sounds like a great package deal! And you too come with a complex package deal  that I fully accept.
I also come with a belief we are a special true one of a kind love where we could grow old together as lovers and friends, very compatible, deep love and respect for you , compassion and empathy for your situation and a desire to make us (and that would include Levi, Abi and Zach ( and your girls although less local! )) work out- to flourish .
I love you so much, and I’m really committed to the inevitable ups and downs/ mis -attunements of us. ( ie all relationships) … 
Let’s try chat on phone tonight?😘❤️",,

Last night you went into a bit of a dark space for a bit on our prospects for longevity, and just a week and a bit ago you told me you are depressed. This has been a bit of a big turn around from the first 10 weeks of getting to know you so only natural that anyone would be questioning how ready you are for a relationship given that you are still going through divorce and personal development. There is no ambivalence on my end and more than happy to embrace this, love and support you now I am starting to understand what’s really going on for you underneath everything. It’s sinking in now that I need to shift my expectations and that’s okay as I let you go through what you need to go through. I agree with everything you have said about us and feel exactly the same way too. I wouldn’t read too much into my short texts today and a phone call later is a great idea! 😘❤️",,

Can I call you on the way back maybe in about an hour?  Or any other time after that is ok too.

I don’t doubt that we have all the signs for longevity - my intention wasn’t to signal I was worried about us. It was more about relationships in general and how they can drastically change over time .  It is anxiety and fear that did raise it’s head at one stage of our chat saying  “ I’m afraid to lose you cause I love you so much, I’m afraid to dive in and there is always an uncertainty ( even if really small) even if  one commits to forever , like one of us will die for example eventually ”  I think I’m gonna just have to marry you to get more certainty lol - see song of the day  to lighten us up again😂. ( tongue in cheek ) 
I’m sorry if I was insensitive or worried you unnecessarily even bringing up the demise of Paul and I from love letters to divorce . If I was my client I would say to me you are subconsciously trying to sabotage this so you can have control over it ending  rather than deal with the uncertainty of life. 
So that’s probs what I was doing . .. not conscious of it at the time though. 

Also my mood is low but it’s very situational and I will be ok - you haven’t taken on some psycho depressed chick who can’t cope - I always cope. That’s my shtick ! xx",,

My day was fantastic and fulfilling. I managed some weight training, enjoyed a 20km cycle along the beach road, and even slow-cooked a roast. Levi was a big help with tidying up the kitchen drawers. I’m truly loving my new job too– it’s fulfilling, and it looks like there’s ample work for the next 12-18 months.

I’m currently waiting for Richard to join me, and then we’re off to the wine bar downstairs. We’ve got a lovely spot booked on the outside terrace.

But honestly, what I’m most looking forward to is winding down early tonight and then being enveloped in the soothing, calming embrace of your presence tomorrow. I love how well we connect, especially when sharing experiences that mean so much to us both. I’m really excited about our coastal walk – it’s just the kind of adventure that brings us closer.

Hope your day was productive too and you managed to have some good client sessions in a different space.

Happy Friday! - in your Barbie dream home. 😜 haha 

😘❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️",,

Thank you for sharing with me the joy you found in your day - you sound so happy and content 😁😃

It has felt like a long time between  embraces as my heart tries patience and trusts our time together will change as it can .I miss being close to you .
For now I will savour  looking forward to our time connecting together tomorrow- so grateful for this.

My day started with a run in the light rain followed by a sweet feeling of togetherness with my kids as we all camped out in Abi’s cosy space together for the day - a heartwarming reminder- our connection still burns strong.

My client sessions were enjoyable and fruitful and the visual feast upon returning home was uplifting. 

Hope your time with Richard was enjoyable x 

Let me know what time you are free for your beautiful bubble- bus babe to pick you up . I’m walking with Sandra at 10.30 /11 and so will be free from 12.30ish .

Thank you so much for your beautiful text message this morning. It was the only one I received all day today. There would have been a time in the past where no one texted me on a public holiday… but with you in my life loveless no more! ❤️❤️❤️

It’s been a busy day but a truly wonderful way to spend Australia Day 🇦🇺. We are camping off Waranga basin. It is lined with wild lavender and home to hundreds of kangaroos. 

We have spent the afternoon roasting a lamb on our camping rotisserie and our esky has been keeping us refreshed with cool drinks. As the sun sets tonight we have fuelled our camp fire with plenty of hardwood to end our day with toasted marshmallows followed by an early night and peaceful sleep.

A perfect boys night away but not for the faint hearted with a gazillion insects and a fervent Aussie sunshine

Not sure if this message will make it as we are pretty much off the grid. Looking forward so much to return to the hood and spending an intimate evening with my true love 🥰

We have spent the afternoon roasting a lamb on our camping rotisserie and our esky has been keeping us refreshed with cool drinks. As the sun sets tonight we have fuelled our camp fire with plenty of hardwood to end our day with toasted marshmallows followed by an early night and peaceful sleep.

A perfect boys night away but not for the faint hearted with a gazillion insects and a fervent Aussie sunshine

Not sure if this message will make it as we are pretty much off the grid. Looking forward so much to return to the hood and spending an intimate evening with my true love 🥰 

Love you so much!

Good night! 😘❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️⛺️😴",IMG_4206.png,Image

In a little white car that looks like any other,

We begin our day, a scene so right.
In this palatial home, our workspaces we claim,
Surrounded by love, yet our focus remains.
Throughout the day, amidst tasks and screens,
We’ll share sweet cuddles, in this realm of dreams.
Kisses in the kitchen, a gentle, loving spree,
In the vastness of this house, we’re free to be.
Oh, home, let me come home, Home is wherever I'm with you,
Oh, home, let me come home, Home is wherever I'm with you…

There are two left on wotif for $658 for 2 nights. I love the cosy room but perhaps only for a one night stay. Lucky we are booking now the rooms are almost all gone… Let me know your thoughts. The flights came to $820 all up - virgin was a LOT cheaper than Jetstar when it came to the times we wanted to fly.Can do the cosy room though if budget is a concern. After 4pm is perfect. Chat soon. xx,,

Just had Interesting chat with Abi - she said although she doesn’t want to meet you she feels relieved as she used to feel she had to look after me as I seemed really sad- now she notices I appear much happier and because she knows I have you in my life she no longer feels she needs to look after me .

I think the Israeli dancing worked a treat on my sleep - an unlikely insomnia intervention! 
Was thinking that the most convenient and economical way to airport and back is if we drive and park - you ok with that? And if so I will book a spot at the terminal car park for us. 
I also reserved parking for 2 nights at the hotel.

I then put on my doctor hat - I think it is probably lung damage from the radiotherapy cause it’s exactly in the same position where radiation was applied .  Yup that’s what it is I’m pretty sure . 

Sorry for my previous text I just love you so much and don’t ever want to cause you any more pain through not being well -that’s just not going to happen…. bit of a freak out and now I’m feeling better and in action mode.

Thank you so much for breakfast this morning. In a bit of uplifting news, I managed to get a discount on a replacement for my beloved sunglasses online – saved $70, which really helps ease the sting of losing them. Losing things often dredges up deeper, more painful losses for me, but this time, I’ve noticed I’m handling it much better. It seems like a sign of real progress in coping with loss, and I’m quietly proud of that.

Our adventure to the city cave was an absolute blast, and I’m so grateful for the carefree enthusiasm you brought to the experience. Despite the aftermath of crusty Epsom salts and the mishap with my sunnies, it was undeniably worth it. In moments when our opportunities to share intimacy are so precious and silly dirty black sheep jokes aside, I believe it’s not just healthy but essential for us to maintain a physical connection as a cornerstone of our relationship. It keeps the flames burning and strengthens our bond in ways words alone cannot. From floating  on water to being sky high in the air, it seems our love for each other has no bounds. 🥰

Also, I mixed up the dates for my picnic today; it’s actually next Sunday, so my day suddenly opened up a bit to some much needed downtime.

Oh, and Marcel reached out this morning with a kind offer to take Levi next weekend. I’ll be dropping him off in Warrandyte on Friday afternoon, which means I’ll need to leave your place around lunchtime to make that happen. Tomorrow is self care day but next weekend my heart’s calendar is totally open for you!

Let me know if you still need support with sending your Sydney trip text to your mum. Shame the timing wasn’t ideal this morning. Still really looking forward to meeting your family and I’m sure they are really looking forward to seeing you and your beautiful face after a good period of time. It will be a pleasure to be by your side as your loving (occasional hair brushing) man.

Can’t wait to see you soon and hope your day is shaping up to be as delightful as our morning together was.

Love you lots. ❤️",,

I was just staring at the photo of us as you texted - I’m waiting in the cool air conditioned car as the real estate agent works his magic . 
Thanks for your update lovely - I love how you share your plans with me - it makes me feel so safe….glad you get a bit of a breather this avo! 
It’s a pity your sunnies went amiss and I’m glad you found a replacement for not too much $$$. Thanks for sharing with me how you feel about losing something - I’m so glad you feel proud of your progress around loss. I’m proud of you too!

I am sooo on the same page as you  that our connection is very much beyond words at times despite our ability to communicate with words deeply and playfully with each other too. And because of this yes it’s important we can see each other often . When I said it’s important to have time apart too, I didn’t mean in any way I wanted more of that ! I was more kinda flexing that I’m ok with your female friendships .. lol cause I feel pretty proud of myself ( and us)for this trust I have in you given the betrayal I experienced. You have truely helped me grow( even though I’m still only 5 foot nothing !) 

I checked my diary and realised what those pesky extra things are- Monday evening I’m picking up Abi from the airport , and Wednesday I have therapy at 4 pm then picking up Zach from Holmesglen - but I would have a window between 530 and 6 to see you for a quick hug or stroll if that worked? Gosh busy week for us .. 

But the bus babe is running her Thursday morning love-mobile service so hopefully will have my very special passenger that day too. 

Thanks for offering your support to text my mum - we can do it next weekend- I can’t wait for you to meet them - it’s scary but it makes us more real .

Enjoy your quieter afternoon. Love you soooooo
much .❤️❤️❤️😘😘😘",,

It keeps going round in my head when I said “it’s good to have time apart “- if you had said that to me in the way I said it I would be upset - I’m sorry ….
- I want to be with you as much as possible, I miss you every moment we are not together . It was a clumsy sentence - I was meaning that things like self care and gym etc are important too but it came out all wrong .

If I could re play that moment I would say :  I love every moment with you and I am left wanting more every time when we say goodbye  AND putting time into your own well-being is important too and I love that you do this for yourself to stay well and healthy. 

Ok that’s the end of my neurotic rant  but it felt important to repair that clumsy sentence cause your facial micro expression told me I wasn’t expressing myself sensitively at the time. 

Love you lots and lots  beautiful man xxx ❤️❤️❤️",,

Every date, I’m more certain of your love for me; I see it there, shining brightly in your eyes. A gaze so full of deep affection is something I’ve never experienced before you. Please know, I’ve not felt upset with you in the slightest.

Following another night and morning filled with such profound connection and intimacy, the thought of parting ways, even temporarily, tugs at my heartstrings. I suspect your keen INFJ - dar sensed my passing melancholy. It’s a pity your schedule is tied up with a client in the morning - spending that time together, unwinding at the hot springs, feels like the perfect form of self-care for both of us. Should any changes free up your time please let me know. 🙏🏻 

Today was spent keeping cool indoors after treating the kids to lunch and bubble tea on Glen Huntley Road. I’ve also dedicated a few hours to work, ensuring I’m fully available to enjoy a morning off down on the peninsula. I’m anticipating alternating between the sauna and cool plunge pool.

In a world without our dependant kids I’d find myself at your side far more often (all the time!), cherishing every aspect of you, especially your endearing neurotic quirks.

😘😘😘",,

I’m so thrilled you can see my love for you in my eyes - you are completely adored  by me  in every way. My gaze,  my heart, my  soul has never desired anyone so deeply as you are by me.  I  am yours and will never stop looking at you with pure love in my eyes .

I love us more and more every day - even though our cute funny texts were so much fun at the start, I truely prefer where we are at now - it feels easier, more real, more comfortable. More deep. More safe.  Our journey beyond today makes me feel so excited … ahead lies our life together ❤️

Your afternoon sounds well spent with your lovely kids- I ended up seeing Sandra for a chat and a cup of tea and then had a refreshing swim 🏊‍♀️ very looking forward to bedtime 🛌 and shutting my eyes.

Enjoy your morning tomorrow.

Yes you are right re our differences- it only took me 48 hours to work out that where we went was beautiful and romantic 🥰 lol .

…so my tears as I wandered the streets soaked with rain as the thunder and lightning struck in the middle of Kew  just means I needed a jumpstart for change ! That’s good to know - this change will include noticing where I parked next time lol. 

Sooo tired  for Israeli dancing but don’t want to bail on Caroline - really shit sleep last night then with people all day long not a moment to come up for air .

Between my insomnia and your nocturnal toilet visits, 50 year old sleep overs sure are slightly more challenging than those of our youth lol! But with you I feel young at heart despite the fatigue of today…and occasionally I have  had a little internal giggle at the thought of you impersonating my primal vocalisations lol 😂. 
Thinking of you today cause I feel deeply your “not quite rightness “ and want to hug you back to feeling better . I love you, I got you, I miss you. Hope your afternoon went well. I really struggled to feel enthusiastic about drumming but did my best to try and enjoy the African rhythms. 

Ps I thought of a mystery date for us on Saturday which would involve starting with a train to the city around 3 pm . A short walk and then something fun outdoors from 4 pm that lasts 2 hours . Let me know if you are happy for me to book our next romantic mystery adventure?

Good morning Besty! I was chuffed with the result of my home-made focaccia this morning in my new multigenerational cast iron pan 😜. It came out super crispy on the outside and super soft on the inside. Levi devoured a piece on the way to school and I put a couple of slices in his lunchbox Super Dad! To the max!  

Gargled with salt water this morning this morning. Will go back to the gym at lunch - feeling hopeful that I’m turning around now.

Keep resting though cause that’s what is most important .

I have made you some food for dinner and I also have some spaghetti bolognaise sauce and pasta for Levi if that would be helpful for tonight? I m just cooking a huge batch for Zach . 

Also if you need anything please tell me …( groceries, Panadol…) 

It takes me a while to process things as you know but this is what I’ve been thinking about meeting Marilyn and Henry …
First I loved seeing you with your family- it was lovely to see the warmth and familiarity between you all. It was also really nice to hear from Marilyn how much Adam loves you .

I realised I felt very comfortable ( considering first time) and relaxed with both M and H.  Marilyn has a sweet unassuming honest down to earthness about her - the fact that she worked as a carer says a lot about her - i really liked how she described one man she looked after and the joy she took from that… that is so different to my old mother in law - I always felt so tense around her and we couldn’t relate as she never worked and her focus was always on the material. 

Henry was equally delightful- in particular his chatty personality and endless stories as he tried so hard to relate and engage - he clearly loves being around people. 

Wow - Romy had a wonderful mum and stepdad…. 

I also really appreciated how at one point you suddenly grabbed my hand - it took me by surprise but with that and other little efforts I felt really supported by you . Thank you .

Ok that’s my delayed debrief lol! 

Love you soooooo much . Feel better xxx ❤️

Ps I hope I never lose you too 😘 I can’t believe the effort you went to to give me that gift 🥰",,
Melanie,2024-02-25 10:46:07,,,,iMessage,Outgoing,,,Delivered,,,"Hey Beautiful girl,

I'm feeling better this morning, after a big relatively uninterrupted sleep to 8:30am, thank you for asking! Energy levels still sub par. Your offer to take Muffin for a walk is incredibly sweet and greatly appreciated. We might just take you up on that before 2 pm. 😊 And after 3 works perfectly as well - perhaps a shady spot in the Goat house park would be a nice way for us to reconnect for a bit. My apartment isn’t off limits either - lets see how I feel.

Your thoughtfulness regarding our dinner is a lifesaver. Levi will be thrilled too - spaghetti bolognese is a kid crowd favourite. Knowing we have a tasty meal waiting for us takes a huge load off my shoulders. You always know how to make everything better.The only thing I probably could do with is more milk and plain yogurt for my smoothies as Ive been living off them, non-homogenous Barambah or Schulz brand a preference but your health conscientious food snob would be perfectly grateful with supermarket A2 milk or plain greek yogurt.

Reflecting on our time with Marilyn and Henry, your observations really resonated with me -I love how you take time to process things and think them through. I do that too! It was indeed special seeing you blend so seamlessly into the fold, and Marilyn's heartfelt words about how much Adam cares for me warmed my heart too - Ive never heard her verbalise that before.  Your apparent comfort and ease around them didn't go unnoticed, and it made the entire experience even more meaningful. Feeling supported and loved by you gives me strength, and I'm just as committed to making you feel cherished and valued - and that will always include thoughtfully timed hand holding… 🥰.The effort for your gift was nothing compared to the joy and happiness you bring into my life every day…Love you soooooo much too. Stay well. ❤️ xxx",,

I realised suddenly now why I’m Jewish - I’m Jewish as I was eventually meant to meet you and be able to blend easily with M and H - I never felt connected to Judaism until now . Small things like understanding when Henry spoke about ?an artist friend who created a Haggadah with indigenous art are not so small when it comes to understanding and connecting. I see how you weren’t looking for an Aussie chick now! 
I wonder if Marilyn felt more comfortable expressing Adams fondness for you indirectly to me - that makes me really happy that possibly having me present can allow for new things to be expressed.
I guess my biggest fear is to feel like an imposition or a reminder of Romy not being there - so all these positive dynamics mean a lot to me . 
I know you keep telling me Marilyn wants you to be re partnered - I’m just seeing now though the courage and generosity of spirit on her part for that desire and support . 

Thanks for letting me know what you need .

I understand if you are too tired to address the below but just putting out there to process even if we chat about it later…

 The psychoanalyst in me wondered if your strong reaction to my not seeing your art till now may be a subconscious grief that I’m not Romy, I don’t appreciate art like she did - which has arisen during this significant time as I have just met her parents . 
Could be wrong but it was a really big response you had- it felt like something else was going on . 

Then separately for myself  I felt so not good enough .. at last I’ve thrown  off the shackles of expectation  so to receive a message e that I should have appreciated something or should be able to focus around me was hard…I’m not going to morph into a gallery loving partner - I’m open to new experiences but don’t want to lose myself again or feel too afraid to be me  and say what I like and don’t like, who I am or am not.  I’m not going to change much - a simple scientist girl with some creativity around words who cuts her cucumbers straight and drinks zymil😉lol
We are similar in so many ways but also different . And relationships are about acceptance of differences. 

I really appreciate you already told me you accept me as I am and at the same time sending this text just to elevate the repair even more as it’s still lingering a bit for me. 

Love you soooo much and I’m so glad we can communicate about these things . ❤️❤️😘😘",,

I mean it just keep doing you, Im not interested in changing you at all - I quite simply love  going for walks along beaches with you and eating in no frills cafes - aesthetic experiences are just an occasional cherry on top for me and happy to take you on those adventures from time to time.  I did feel horrible at my over reaction - I’m really sorry. Perhaps it was a subconscious thing because Romy loved it and I have an expectation that everyone has to love it too. I can be direct and blunt and it gets me in trouble sometimes - this behaviour will probably pop up again but I’ll keep an eye on it. This not being good enough feeling you are having is a worry though- you are everything to me in my eyes. You can choose what way to cut your cucumbers I really don’t care. What ever you do it always comes from a place of compassion and love and that is perfectly enough for me. 🥰  Nah We are mostly similar - I’ve never met someone as deep and introspective as me.

.. I know it’s a different side of the same coin - I take your bluntness with your passion.  It’s equally up to me to understand you as it is for you to know I’m really sensitive to what might be perceived as criticism even if that’s not what you meant. 
I just didn’t feel good enough in that moment but generally I feel good about me.
Don’t ever dampen down your desires and appreciation around aesthetics- neither of us should lose ourselves in each other - we both have done that before. I’m so happy to be by your side as you open up the beauty of the world to me . 
The funny thing is I DO really like that piece of art - the colours are spectacular… it’s just that I’d never seen it before . … lol 😂 both muffin and you are highly distracting!

My session with Dr Foulkes was really good, helpful and nice to get out for a drive in the beautiful weather. I didn’t even realise that it was going to be hot this week. I hope I am feeling better by Thursday, is there another window open for us to try that sneaky swim? -  I sure could do with getting off the couch. Wow a busy client day tomorrow. Your weeks sure do get busy. My new fitted linen sheet arrived today so perhaps that will help with some good sleep tonight. Im good for things - I think Marilyn is helping tomorrow afternoon and she usually brings more food for us. MIss you so much too! Glad you miss your Blunty and your Besty. Lol.🤜🏻🦠🩳👙😘❤️",,

Tomorrow is 35 deg - I pick up Zach from holmsglen at 4.30 as the pt from there is no good, and drop him at gym then  I’m home by 4.45 and Zach gets pt home from gym and is usually home by 6.15/30. 
So would like a quick dip between 5 and 6 tomorrow ? 
I can’t promise I’ll swim after big day at work but I’ll keep you company if you are keen.

Even though we spoke about our tricky stuff - I still felt a burst of renewal after seeing you… you still feel like my home base and I hope you feel like I am yours.

Just wanted to say getting out and about, and just being with you, all the hugs and kisses, really lifted me up. Can’t wait to see you again tomorrow!

Tonight, I’m chilling on the couch, whipping up some ginger-lemon tea with honey – feels like I’m finally turning a corner!

Oh, and I was thinking about that buffet and hutch you have got. Unsolicited advice, I’ve been selling a bit of stuff on Gumtree in the past and did pretty well, so I thought, why not list it for a price? If it cost a pretty penny, I reckon you could get at least get half back. It’s worth a shot, especially with some time to spare before the settlement. But hey, it’s totally up to you - Paul thinks you are going to give it away now anyway so might as well try. The buyer will still take it off your hands and it’s a bit different to trying to sell an old couch.

Love you 😘",,

I’m absolutely thrilled that you enjoyed my cooking, and equally chuffed that you have come to me as a vegetarian. It’s an area you can really get creative in when it comes to concocting some delicious flavours. Yesterday, I put in a little extra effort and visited the Indian spice shop on Carslie Street to get paneer and some premium garam masala. I had ambitious plans to make aloo parantha, an Indian flatbread filled with potatoes, onions, coriander, and spices, somewhat similar to naan. Time got the better of me, though, so it turned into a late lunch project today, and I’ve frozen the extra flatbreads for later. They turned out so delicious with last nights leftovers. Your feedback meant the world to me and truly brightened my day. I can’t wait to cook for you again soon. 🥰

I understand cooking for me might seem a tad intimidating , but please remember, your care and efforts in feeding me are genuinely appreciated.  Some of your meals to date have really hit the mark for me too - hello chicken vege cheesy bake 🤤👌🏻– The act of you feeding me is a gesture of care that I cherish deeply.

Following last night’s feast of nutrient dense vegetables and the IV drip of love from  Dr. Melanie, your chronically ill boyfriend has experienced a remarkable turnaround. His condition has improved so significantly that he has been moved out of the ICU and is now eagerly awaiting discharge.🥳🥰❤️…lol

The flatbread looks soooo good too!  I just enjoyed your vegetarian stew for dinner hoping Zach would ask me what it was so I could mention my beautiful Nathan to him but alas no, he didn’t wonder what I was eating . Will keep making an effort though to mention you. It’s really important to me after our conversation last night . 

Yes intimidating is right but it comes from myself as that’s not your intention . I don’t like not being good at things lol but my new approach is that I will see this as an opportunity to learn from you. Already my salmon cooked in butter tasted better and my smoothies with full cream a2 taste so much better . I might get fat though lol! I’m not going to make you food you won’t eat - I will ask you first what you like  and take any tips you have. Thanks for appreciating the gesture  of me cooking for you it’s sweet, but at same time I really don’t like receiving food from people that doesn’t work for me so I don’t want to give you food that isn’t right for you - more communication is the key - I will keep trying but check in first with you.


When I walked with Teri today she said she picked up a lovely energy from you when she met you - well spotted by Teri - you do have a most lovely energy my love❤️ Not like your dog sitting treat feeding know it all make your dog shit everywhere lady lol! 

I’m thrilled the IV love drip as well as  the ( weirdly reversed ! ) massive intravaginal injection that you gave Dr Strang seemed to be a miraculous cure for you.  A script for more of those injections have been ordered for next weekend - I don’t want you back in the ICU so I insist on compliance with this medical directive lol! 

Yes next stop Sydney and my sister does want to meet . We are looking at 3 pm Saturday if you ok with that too?  Quick coffee.  Well even if it’s awkward I get to show off my Besty to everyone ❤️❤️😘😘

These past few weeks of sickness, I've felt a bit adrift, but being with you, immersed in the joy of our shared moments, has rejuvenated my spirit. Looking forward to being by your side again very soon! I miss you too…

Our getaway was a success in every sense. Meeting your friend Michelle was one of the highlights for me. Her kind-heartedness and unique perspective on the world is refreshing. She's genuinely authentic, a rare find and can see why you have a close friendship. A shame it was brief but I wouldn’t say no to hanging out with her with you again sometime.

While I'm still piecing together the complexities of your relationship with your mother, I did notice that the love she has for you is unmistakable. Your Bestys INFJ dar senses he would  find it difficult having a relationship with her too- the orderliness and the controlling behaviour. Nonetheless, it’s evident that your upbringings have intricately moulded you, with your resilience and kindness shining through brilliantly. This strength, a mirror of my own. I think it’s our shared resilience that forms the bedrock of our bond, fostering a mutual respect that is both deep and unwavering to me. 🥰

Your father's warmth and humour doesn’t fall far from the tree haha  - his stories, his laughter, and even his vulnerabilities added layers to an already enjoyable visit - sharing his experiences freely, especially the poignant loss of his sister.

And your sister, with her distinct personality, only added to the rich tapestry of your family. Each member, so different, yet together, forming quite a typical Jewish family - one that I am quite familiar - and at home - with.

My greatest highlight of the weekend - outside of our exceptional love making ❤️😈🥰- was your beaming smile and gratitude when we left your parents house. I loved how grateful you were - that I played a supporting role in your family reunion. The  weekend not only lifted my spirits but also solidified my admiration and love for you.

Love you so much Melanie… ❤️❤️❤️",,

I love most of all how you see all the qualities in my dad that I deeply admire too - vulnerability, humour and warmth. He is an open book, an open comic book sometimes ! 
It’s helpful that through  your eyes you can see my mum loves me as it’s hard to feel it from her. 

I was soooo grateful to feel you  fully return to me on our holiday as your adrift ness was noticed with loving concern - I am forever by your side  though to ride the waves with you …I trust our deep and unwavering connection will always bring us back to each other  as we each move from troughs to peaks and everything in between.  I truely was so incredibly proud to have you by my side as my loving man as we visited my parents. I just adore you way beyond what words can describe.  I come back from days together with you and seriously wonder how much longer we can not live together - but my parenting heart tells me to be patient.  There are steps we need to slowly take although every part of me just wants to snuggle into you every night. 
Love you sooooooooooooooooo very very much 😘

Me too! There was a music shop in turramurra near the station that I often frequented too- when I would buy sheet music for my piano. I’m so glad we went to the trouble of revisiting that part of our lives together. I love our love story so much. In so many ways it feels like we were meant to cross paths one day. We are so lucky to have this feeling of familiarity. Like we have already been Bestys forever. 🥰🥰🥰,,

At the Love Factory we are in surplus of intravaginal injections - they are going to expire soon and as a company policy we never stockpile our medications so I have taken the liberty to book you in for at least weekly injections to ensure a complete recovery. I’m sure your doctor has advised you as well that there is a “ maintenance phase”  for your treatment to ensure you remain in good health  even after recovery. This maintenance phase lasts many years - I’m sure you will tolerate this ongoing treatment regime quite well - many patients find it exhilarating!

Ps was a bit upset to only find out now that you currently use weed - I thought that was a thing of the past . The actual use of it bothers me a bit ( not hugely if it’s infrequent) but what bothers me more is that it felt a bit non transparent that I didn’t know till today . And you know a lack of transparency is not easy for me. 
We can chat about it later - I’m ok- stuff comes up - that’s relationships - so we will talk about it and work through . 
Xx

Also you have a family history of psychosis so using THC puts you more at risk for a psychotic episode . That worries me a bit..

Love you xx",,

I do feel it’s a significant fact that seems to have been omitted and maybe there is some explanation that I’ve missed or misunderstood so need to talk to you to clarify but  this feels pretty shit for me as I’m currently seeing it . … 

I can’t get my head around that we are 5 months into this and this part hasn’t been mentioned. I feel so angry.  What happened to knowing each others values and being open about everything?  I didn’t get the opportunity to decide if this was something I am ok about before falling for you and now I have fallen in love with you  without knowing this part of you ..so that’s fucked  and it’s not honest.  It’s not hard to see how this feels like betrayal again.

I’m not sure if it was a coincidence that you told me today more about how Levi’s life began or if it was consciously well timed just before I meet him. … either way it was an important part of yours and Levi’s and Romy’s story and I’m so glad you shared it with me. 

I love your excitement around me meeting Levi -
I know we are partly trying to say it’s not a big thing but I really do hope that it’s the start of an important relationship between Levi and I … and that is a big thing in my eyes. 

Time to strap on my fairy wings! 🧚‍♀️

I have thoroughly enjoyed your clever and heartfelt service since signing up almost 6 months ago - it has brought me great joy. That’s fine about the pivot your business model has undertaken. Is your exclusive “adult phone entertainer”, known simply as “word mistress”, a bit naughty with a deep desire to intimately connect? Does she fantasise of being ravished by a sexy man and his big c$&k? I have become very fond of her songs and poems and nothing would interest me more than to be able press 1,2,3 and 4 (when eligible) and have renewed correspondence with her in the scope of this exciting new product line.

Your valued customer,

Nathan Vale

Your enthusiasm for seeing naked pictures of me is very apparent given you have made a diary note. Please do send me reminders when your diary note appears. Your assigned “word mistress “ is indeed very very naughty and feels deeply connected to you too. She wants nothing more than for you to ravish her with your big throbbing c@&$. She wants you inside her more than she has ever wanted any other man - you drive her crazy. Pictures of your throbbing cock may move you closer to level 4, but most likely not as your word mistress has never delivered this service before and is currently in training - daily practice photos of her fingering her wet, pulsating and turned on self  open and longing for your manhood are incredibly sexy but will most likely only ever be released under very extenuating circumstances. We secretly hope you can work out what these circumstances are. 

We hope your enjoyment of this new product line means you will continue to be a loyal customer for  many years to cum.

Morning sweet man. My response to your words above will definitely need to wait until after dark… lol

Gorgeous man, I was reflecting on yesterday and I just want to say that I think it’s frickin amazing the sorts of conversations we are having at not even 6 months in . We are a dream come true to me - to be able to express my vulnerability at feeling “ I’ve done something wrong, I’m not good enough” in response to a vulnerable part of you that might fear feeling out of control is just the essence of healthy communication. May we never ever stop doing this. 
May we never stop realising “ it’s not about the mats” .. even if they are made of genuine leather and came at a cost! 
Love you endlessly.❤️❤️",,

Our communication style is wonderfully effective when it comes to using vulnerability and understanding of each other. And meeting your parents has also given me invaluable insights into what your childhood was like for you, particularly the dynamics of living with your mother. It's clear that some aspects of our personalities are deeply ingrained and challenging to change. Yet, it's fortunate that we met at a time when we're entering a mature phase of our lives. We've learned to coexist with our inherent behavioral tendencies and, through mutual understanding, we're quick to recognize and address them when they surface.

We’re good. Love you endlessly and back. ❤️❤️",,

Those exact eyes and your beautiful profile have won over my heart in our present. A huge part of me (not my cock haha) wishes I had met you back then - I would have fallen head over heels for you ,the moment I laid eyes on you - just like when we finally did meet. But I just wasn’t the man I am today. We would have just been two naive kids in love, without the skills to nurture it and we would have definitely failed - assuming you would have been interested in me romantically 24 something years ago! So our timing in the end was just perfect. Let’s make up for the lost time with the many years of deep love for each other ahead . Love you so much… 👌🏻❤️❤️❤️",,

I hope you are enjoying the perfect weather tonight. A perfect ending to a perfect long weekend. I now have an evening date with you playing out in my imagination - because I love being with you too…

With the balcony door thrown wide, the soothing cadence of heavy rain melds with the warmth of a gentle breeze. It’s a setting that whispers for us to be cocooned on the couch, enveloped in shared banter and laughter. Later, as the night deepens and the rain’s melody lulls the world to sleep, we’d retreat under the caress of fresh sheets, the cool fabric contrasting with the warmth of our closeness, encapsulating a perfect moment of deep connection and intimacy.

Perhaps open some of the windows in your home tonight, allowing the bouquet of rain soaked earth and the freshness of the night air transport you into the heart of my envisioned date - where every sensation is amplified. 

Can’t wait for us to be  together again. 🥰🥰🥰",,

And yes Levi is a huge part of that, that I deeply wish to strengthen too.  I’m so excited to spend more time together, the 3 of us - it feels strangely ….. right. Thank you for trusting me with this very special part of you . 

Thanks for describing our rainy date in your imagination- I’m right there with you sweet man - snuggling  into your soft sweet smelling neck, planting kisses all over your gorgeous face as we sit like perfectly fitting jigsaw pieces together on your couch. Then take me to your bed so we can kiss and lie so close that our lips touch as we breathe each other in. Don’t let me go - I love you so much.

I was in the house I bought - it was your mums old house I had bought from her . Really high ceilings with cupboards all the way up to ceiling - we ( me and you) were discussing how useless they were as too high to reach without a ladder …there were some odd things like a rocking horse on a high up shelf and I was wondering if it would be cleared out before I move in . 
Your mum was there but at a distance - we were together on a couch and you were naked - I remember thinking how vulnerable you looked - I wanted to protect you but then you left and I was left in house with just your mum .  I asked her if it would be uncomfortable to visit me here at her old place .
I woke wondering where you had gone and worried you had no clothes on. ",,

You’re closing in on a challenging chapter, and soon, it’s time to celebrate the incredible person you are! I have the perfect evening planned for us: a night at a this little European wine bar, where we can get sexy as dressed up, explore 1 glass of the finest 🍷 on offer and enjoy the cozy, sophisticated atmosphere together. It’ll be an evening to honour your resilience, to embrace the beautiful new beginnings ahead, and to celebrate in true Nathan and Melanie style - most likely giggles and double trouble in the dimly lit corner 😈😉 . Let’s raise our glass to you, to us, and to a future filled with love and happiness. Are you ready for a memorable night out? 🍷❤️ Press 1, 2 or 3 for YES PLEASE along with the date in DDMMYYYY numerical format - followed by #  and three love heart emojis.

Wonderful wordsmith - thank you for your romantic invitation 💕🥰
The date looks significant with just 2’s and 4’s in it.  In Jungian thinking 4 is about stability , wholeness, completeness. I definitely feel more complete with you Bestie in my life.

Thank you for seeing my resilience - I invite us to celebrate yours too on this night…You have equally bounced back from so much lately and of course stretching back.

I’d love nothing more than to sit in this wine bar’s dimly lit corner with you…. gaze into your eyes, admire your handsome face and kiss your sweet lips. I’d savour every sip of my one 🍷 as we giggle the night away. Laughing with you as the rest of the world fades into oblivion is my favourite thing to do.

Thank you Bestie. I’m ready to celebrate our love, moving onwards towards more love and connection and joy.

But your dress code description left things open to my imagination.
Press 1 for black sexy jeans and fitted white tshirt and healed boots
Press 2 for epson salts long golden dress 
Press 3 for I don’t care just pack your black lingerie for later 

Love you 😘",,

Today was a productive day marked by ticking more items off my to-do list. I gave the stinky laundry a thorough hospital grade clean and tackled Muffin’s bed, which was overdue for a 90 degree hot water wash. Had an intense upper body workout at the gym. In the afternoon, I baked delicious Vegemite scrolls, a special treat for Levi as I picked him up from school - a rare joy since our nanny is away. Now, we’re nestled in the living room, wrapped in cozy doonas for a snug movie night, the sliding doors open to invite the evening breeze. Also Levi is in the Jewish News! - he looks very handsome posing in a Sholem

Make videos of your cock inside me slowly penetrating me as I sit on you. We would play back the video together and watch you move my black g string off to the side as your fingers explore inside of my wetness . 
Would you like to control me like last time? Perhaps handcuff me so I am even more powerless to your animal cravings - do it! Take control so that I am your toy and you are my master - be rough with me. Throw me hard onto your bed.

Yes…

The animal in me still desires to pick you up and roughly throw you on to my bed. 

I’ll demand to  see you  on your back - with your spread legs wide apart for me. 

I’ll direct you to put your hand down your black g string - play with yourself and moan for me. 

I’ll kneel over your face and give you  permission to play with my throbbing cock, move your tongue all over and take it in. 

Simultaneously my fingers will part your g string to one side as I explore your wetness and tease you to the brink. 

Not before I pick up my hand cuffs and take complete control of you. 

In your state of full submission I will caress and kiss your body all over before going down on you - again teasing you to the brink.

With cuffs now off I’ll give you permission to sit on me - in reverse - so I can pick up my camera and video you riding my cock - the slow penetration on full display for us to  play back together…

The next time, before I plan to make you my play toy again.

And I want all of this?

Because you are so beautiful and deeply desired. 😈

Your profile caught my eye as I am also Jewish and live nearby - a rare find on these apps!  I’d love to find out a bit more about you .

Nathan 15/10/23Hi Joyy - thanks for your message and interest in me. I am part of a tiny family of just me and my son. He is 7 and in grade one at Sholem Alechiem college. I’m a widower so my support with him comes from grandparents and a nanny. When I’m not looking after him I love going to the movies, seeing live music and eating out. I’m very active at the local group fitness gym with a bit of bike riding and lots of walking!
I’m also an independent IT contractor in software engineering. Hope you are having a good weekend and haven’t been affected by the terrible events recently. Would love to chat some more. Nathan 🙏🏻

(Joyy)MelanieThanks for your reply Nathan . My name is actually Melanie - oops forgot to say that in my last message. 
I’m really sorry to hear you lost your partner . I can’t even imagine what that might have been like . I’m glad for you that. you feel ready to look for another partner .
Both my kids went to Sholem Aleichem too! They are 16 and 19 now. I’m sure we would have lots in common and many common connections.
Yes, recent events have been quite horrific- I hope you don’t have any direct connection to it . Either way the suffering of anyone is not ok.
I too love fitness and health - I’m going on a cycling holiday in New Zealand in December.  
Do you have dogs to walk?  That’s usually what gets people walking a lot 😀
Love to chat more . 
Mel

Nathan (15/10/23 9:01pm)
Hi Mel, Thanks for your kind words. It’s been over a few years now so definitely feel ready. I think relationships, especially intimate ones, are an important part of life.
I also have teenager daughters 14 and 19 but the youngest lives with her mum in Geelong and the eldest has moved out of home and is studying arts at La Trobe uni. We don’t see them much now but when they were younger they visited every second weekend - since 2012.
Sounds like we have a bit in common. Sleeping, eating well and being active are all good things. Your holiday sounds perfect to me. Are you into road biking? I spend most of my time on my road bike along beach road. I’m looking forward to spending late December and a part of January up in Sydney at my mums place. She lives on the beach up there on the northern beaches - looking forward to lots of surfing and swimming.
Yes! I have a dog. She’s a very friendly Bichon Frise. She is 3 and has been a wonderful companion. I walk her almost every day from the school drop off all the way up to Harleston Park and back. 
What’s on for you this week? I finished up an IT contract last week so I have some time to catch up on life things. Although the weather is looking good on Wednesday so I’m thinking of driving down to Mornington hot springs and spending the day rejuvenating!

Melanie

Yes I agree - intimacy is as essential as sleep, exercise and healthy food - it must be the fourth pillar !  I don’t generally cycle day to day - I walk a lot mainly and practice qi gong. 

 your trip to Sydney sounds like something to look forward to . My parents live in Sydney too. The northern beaches are beautiful- I grew up in Sydney from age 12 in St Ives and went to Masada College for a bit and then Killara High School - did you grow up in Sydney?  Before Sydney I went to primary school in Scotland. We emigrated to Australia when I was 12. 

Bichone Frise are the teddy looking dogs? Very cute . I am quite dog mad - I have 3 of them! A kelpie x, a terrier x and a cavoodle. I used to incorporate 2 of them in my work so that’s my excuse for having so many lol! 

This week brings the usual work schedule- although it’s pretty quiet…

NathanOh wow that’s interesting, There are a few more things in common there. I grew up in Sydney near Wahroonga and went to Knox Grammar School for Junior and Senior School. My mum emigrated from Scotland when she was six so I am half Scottish. I still have a Scottish great aunt who lives in Sydney. She is 91 now. Sadly my Scottish grandparents have passed away now.

Yes my dog looks like a teddy bear. Haha. That’s great that you are also a dog lover.

Perhaps we could meet up during the week for a chat if you have some time in your schedule?

MelanieGosh - we probs lived around the corner from each other - we lived in Turramurra for a few years which I think borders Wahroonga?
Amazing similarities re the Scottish connection!  We will have to compare Scottish accents - 😉 how unlikely is it to meet another  Scottish Jew on these silly apps lol 
My Scottish grandparents have also passed away . 
With all these similarities, how could we not catch up ?! Tuesday morning or Friday afternoon look the quietest times for me if either of those times suited you ?Nathan 16/10/23 7:55pmThese are all very intriguing similarities- although I have to confess that I wasn’t born Jewish. It has just been a big part of my life over the last 10 years - as you can imagine having a Jewish partner and now raising a Jewish son. I’m mostly secular but exposed to the religious side a little bit on Levi’s grandfathers side of the family. Meeting a Scottish Jew wasn’t on my 2023 bingo card though! I have wondered if you have a Scottish accent from 12 years exposure as a child. Mum emigrated when she was 6 and she has no accent at all. I bet your mum does though! 
A would love to catch up. Friday afternoon sounds good as I’m busy tomorrow before I go away for a mid week break. The weather should be a little warmer by then too. Let me know what time suits?MelanieThat’s such a noble gesture  to honour Levi’s Jewish connections.  I must say you look very Jewish in your photos … do people say that? 
My relationship to Judaism is not at all traditional- I am completely non- observant . Mainly because growing up, I went to an all girls Christian school in Scotland and the odd time we went to shul  it was about standing there looking like we were doing the right thing without any spiritual connection to the religion. 
I consider myself spiritual but not religious.  Funnily , I’ve never felt Jewish and can’t explain that except once I found my mums birth certificate which said she was adopted- I sometimes wonder if she was born Jewish  or not .  I do love the community aspect and the safety of what religion can provide, but organised religion, not for me.
I do still have a tinge of Scottish accent - my kids try get me to say words with a double “o” in them so they can laugh at me lol!  Yes my parents speak like Billy Connolly. 
I’d love to catch up Friday - my last client finishes at 1.30 pm so I could meet you around 2 pm if that worked? 
Enjoy your mid week break - so lovely for you . 😊

Nathan 17/10/7:56pm

Great! 2pm on Friday works. Perhaps meet up at Caulfield park? Corner of Balaclava/Hawthorn road. We could get a take away drink and stroll over to the park?

Melanie 17/10/23 9:02pm

Sounds perfect - look forward to meeting you .

Nathan 19/10/23 5:19om

You too. See you then. Thanks Mel!

Nathan 21/10/23 9:16am

Hi Melanie,

It was lovely to meet you yesterday. I was hoping for a sunny spring goldilocks afternoon. You know when there’s a gentle warmth on the skin when standing directly under the sun, yet a cool undercurrent in the shade that provides a refreshing contrast? But of course this is Melbourne so who knows what you will end up with! Perhaps we are in for a hot summer this year. Nevertheless I really enjoyed our rendezvous. It was meaningful and honest. You have a calming energy about you and of course a lovely beauty. Im sure there is a lot more to discover about each other. If you are interested  in gently pursuing things along a romantic path, and perhaps a potential escape over the tall walls of this dating app, then please feel free to text me on 0475638039. Would love to hear from you again.

Morning besty ❤️
Hope you slept well after your busy Tuesday. 
I think the Israeli dancing worked a treat on my sleep - an unlikely insomnia intervention! 
Was thinking that the most convenient and economical way to airport and back is if we drive and park - you ok with that? And if so I will book a spot at the terminal car park for us. 
I also reserved parking for 2 nights at the hotel.

Today I made the most delicious batch of macadamia nut and spinach/ basil pesto along with some fresh pasta with my kitchen aid 🍝 

Levi devoured the whole bowl too - super chuffed as it is a great way to get greens into him. I’ll make it for you one time my mediterranean diet loving Betsy 🥰 So much you can do with pesto. I’m looking forward to putting it into my omelette tomorrow for extra flavour. 

Levi was dressed up in his yontif clothes for the school seder today. Poor Levi has three Seders this year lol. Looking forward to ours - Marilyn said she has ordered the usual fare from Lenny’s. Did you say you were getting a cake and salad? I’ve lost track…

A couple of meetings at work today and finally officially kicked off the new project so lots of work on now. .

Thats great the big $$$ has exchanged hands with the new owner and that’s another step closer to complete financial independence - amazing 🎉🎉🎉

Must feel good to have had a productive day at work Besty!

Love you so much -  even one day apart feels like a stretch… pathetic lol. 😂 

Yours only,

Sexy sweet man. xxx

And little Levi - was great bonding time at the park - I automatically stuck out my hand to cross the road and he just took it comfortably and easily - very sweet moment … along with his ease using my name and enthusiasm to play the new game we talked about at the park .

I can’t believe I miss you already . 
Love you so very very much Besty .

I slept for about an hour and a half when I got home, woke up when my second dose was really kicking in.

I am so grateful that one of the scout parents offered to drive Levi home so I don’t have to go anywhere to get him. However, I did go and pick up muffin from Caulfield North, and it was lovely to hear how much fun the family  had with her company. It was bittersweet when one of the mums mentioned Dassis book and made the connection that Romy is my late partner. Apparently she is mentioned a lot through the book as they were close friends, and now I feel a mix of emotions - sadness, guilt, and in attention. But, finishing that book is high on my list of things to do now - as well as reconnecting with Dassi and our friendship.

Today feels like a bit of a come down with this tiredness, but I have a feeling that I’m gonna be so tired tonight that I’m just gonna sleep right through.

Happy to help with handyman stuff around your house. Perhaps next time I’ll take off all my clothes and wear just my toolbelt  😉 haha.

I am glad I left a good impression with Sandra, and it feels great to see our relationship starting to widen amongst our own network groups.

Yay to no credit card debt! I hope you’ve cut up any cards that you have left!

My heart aches in your absence, longing for your presence once again. The lovely bouquet of 🌹 you gifted me serves as a sweet reminder of the incredible evening we shared, filled with passion and adventure. I miss you deeply, my love.

😘❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️",,

Don’t know what I believe anymore, maybe that’s ok 
I think I’m ready to forgive myself

And speaking of home, your new place? Absolutely amazing! How you got everything set up so fast is beyond me. It’s like a cozy little nest that’s so you in every way. I’m really looking forward to making some new memories there with you.

Today's been a whirlwind, honestly. Had my therapy session where we talked more about the meds and the exciting growth in my life. It was a good talk, but then the traffic on the way back was just insane! I may be able to swap my session with another one of his clients to Monday noon. Fingers crossed 🤞 Now I'm chilling at the Scout Hall, just dreaming about heading home to relax.

Thanks again for seeing me and everything I'm trying to do. It means a lot. Miss you and love you lots! 😘❤️❤️❤️",,

Thanks for sending your love  - it was well received. I hope you had a lovely day with your family too.

At Malvern Central Levi got some new school sport’s shoes -super cute when they try them on and walk around the store and fuss about the fit. Then Marilyn treated us to some morning tea, which was lovely.

After tea, we all walked to the florist. Levi chose some beautiful red roses for Marilyn, and we shared a big hug and kiss to celebrate Mother's Day together. It was really special.

Marilyn then dropped us off when she headed back home. We took Muffin for a walk in Harleston Gardens, which was as beautiful as always. We also finished up Levi’s room with our matching rug to the living room that really ties it all together.

We then had a special lunch together  at 48 Hour down stairs , which opened just for Mother's Day such a treat since they're usually closed on Sundays and don't open for lunch. Levi loved his ragu bambini pasta, and I indulged in a seafood pizza with smoked salmon and caviar—so good! 🤤 

Wrapped up the day with a little nap, some quirky fun with programming Siri to daily announce my weight in a tongue and cheek way (Levi found it hilarious!), and a FaceTime chat with Mum.

Although Mother’s Day can be a bit much for us, we kept it light and enjoyable. Really wish you were here to share these moments with us, but I’m holding you in my heart until we can be together again. Miss you immensely and can’t wait to catch up tomorrow ! 💖

PS: I really cherished our brunch this morning. It was one of my favorite ones to date, especially in terms of connection and communication. Especially diving into some topics that are uniquely ‘us’ eg 🍆 😂 was a nice distraction from the cafe full of families and mothers. Walking down to the beach afterwards, with the sun on our backs and the perfect still bay in front of us, made the morning absolutely perfect. Thanks Besty Love you 😘❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️",,

I was so surprised how overcome with emotion I was this morning- it wasn’t pity or sympathy or anything like that -  just pure sadness in that moment cause I love you so much and your loss was felt in my heart deeply in that moment. 

Yes our brunch was a delight ! You see Sweetman it’s true that little hurdles bring us closer - maybe that’s why I yearn for more “ material” …
this wave of yours loves feeling close to you 🥰

Abi came over for tea and cheesecake and we sat out on the deck in the sun and chatted and threw the ball for Gibson.  
Then I took Gibby to the field more more of the same.

I then cooked and cooked and got into a state of flow with it which felt great - palak paneer  with brown rice and cauliflower fritters . Yum !

Miss you and love you sooooooo much Best One 🍆 😂 ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️😘😘😘😘😘😘

Sounds like you've had a pretty full-on day too! I had a mix of ups and downs. The highlight was definitely hearing about Levi's amazing day at school for Yom HaAtzmaut—he was so excited about it , and it made me really happy. I also roasted a chicken that turned out exceptionally well. However, work was still quite stressful due to ongoing blockages, but things started flowing better around lunchtime. 

I had a great chat with my therapist about potentially switching to the long-acting ADHD medication, which might help with my hyperfocus issues. And yeah, I've been thinking about our Saturday night together at your new place—can't wait! Hope you managed to get those bedside tables sorted out. Visual spatial skills can be tricky, but I'm sure you'll “nail it” haha.

I wanted to share why I love you so much. Our deep emotional connection and mutual understanding make me feel so cherished. Our shared background strengthens our bond in such a unique way.

Your compassion and care are a constant source of comfort. I admire your intelligence and your curiosity about personal development and psychology; it resonates deeply with me.

Your affectionate texts, poems, and thoughtful gestures always make me feel loved. I adore your sense of humor and the playful banter that brings so much joy into my life.

Our shared interests, from cooking and watching movies to exchanging music and nostalgic memories, bring us even closer. I appreciate your commitment to health and fitness, which aligns with my own, and your resilience and strength, especially after your journey through cancer and separation, inspire me every day.

Your creativity, artistic nature, and reflective personality perfectly complement my own passions.

Thank you for being the incredible person you are. I love you more than words can express. 🥰😘❤️❤️ 🌊

I really really really appreciate the effort you went to to send that text. Thank you x Especially when I know how tired you feel right now. 
I love you so very very much.
You have been the only man ever in my life that has given me a feeling of safety and security. Your reliability is so very valued by me and this recent blip is just a blip - once a wave, always a wave? Or at least wave ish. But generally please know my waters have felt calmer than they ever have around you- your loyalty is obvious and the trust I have in you is immense and true.  From time to time I will get this insecure feeling but please know that the last 7 months with you prior to the last 2 weeks I have felt pretty secure.  The insecurity is not about myself - I value me a lot and know I have lots to offer as a partner, friend, psychologist etc. 
it comes from a fear of being let down again .  There is no evidence of that from you at all - its simply a reaction from me to your side effects / fatigue - a story my body remembers despite my head telling my emotions they really are misplaced.
I do struggle it’s true, to move back into my prefrontal cortex , it’s a struggle since I was born from what I have been told. It’s a flaw or perhaps just a part of me that I keep trying to manage better . I don’t think it’s going away any time soon but I hope you can love and accept that part of me too.  I’ll keep working on it - I know it’s better than it used to be.
Thank you for being so uniquely Nathan - you are one of a kind - so incredibly special to me -I adore your passion and energy - I adore your essence your soul. … your sweetness . …can’t wait to lie in ( low allergy , natural ingredients, high quality goldilocks style) bubbles with you 😜 😂 and snuggle together . It’s been a big 2 weeks for you getting used to this med and topped off with your partners response to it too! 
Adversity can only add to our story and make us closer .
Love you lots. Have a good day xxxx 😘❤️

I wanted to take a moment to thank you for the truly special night we shared. Finally having a sleepover at your place was such a significant moment for us, and it meant the world to me. Your sweet gestures, like cleaning the sheets, made me feel incredibly loved and appreciated. It was clear how much effort you put into making everything perfect, and I’m so grateful for that.

Our evening together was amazing, from the delicious salmon dinner over conversations to our stoic attempt at watching a movie - even though we only made it through ten minutes before we were all over each lol,  it was a perfect - “Netflix and Chill Date” ✅.

When I saw the photo of us in your bedroom I was reminded how deeply you care about me, it touched me deeply. The intimacy we shared there was beyond words, the way we connect physically and emotionally is something I cherish deeply.

Loved the Bunnings date and walk around Karkarook park yesterday with Muffin too, our laughter over the 'shit sandwich' incident 😂, and our deep conversations about life, my medication, and our relationship made me feel even closer to you.

Thank you for making everything so memorable and for being such a significant part of my life. I can't wait for our next adventure together!

Melanie,2024-05-21 20:06:47,2024-05-21 20:07:00,,,iMessage,Outgoing,,,Delivered,,," Hey Ms Bestie,

I had quite the eventful day! I totally crushed it at the gym and got a gold medal for my cardio session! 🎉 It was such a surprise because I didn't think I was hitting the right heart rate, but I guess I was recovering well enough. Super proud of myself for that!

Levi and Dassi hit it off yesterday afternoon so I finally told Jan we don't need her on Mondays anymore - she had a massive look of disappointment on her face and then blamed me her for not giving her enough notice - she very recently knocked back a job for next Monday. But It felt so empowering to take that step. Now she'll be around for just four hours a week instead of six. Progress!

Volunteering at Scouts was a bit of a circus, though. I had to deal with traffic driving to and from therapy, then straight to Scouts. The kids were a handful, wanting to play more than learn, but I managed. Had a great chat with the Scout leaders about Levi. He's getting bored with Joeys, so we're thinking of moving him up to Cubs. He even led the group tonight and came up with the idea to build lanterns. Seeing him take charge made me so proud.

Muffin had her own little adventure today! We went for a walk to Coles, but I totally forgot to take the rubbish bin out. When Jan and Levi came home, they found Muffin had thrown a party with the trash! 😂 The place was a mess, which is hilarious considering all the effort I put into making everything look perfect before she arrives. So much for trying to impress!

And thank you so much for your sweet idea about a special present for Levi on Romy's anniversary. I can't wait to hear more about it. It means a lot to me.

I really miss you and can't wait to see you - tomorrow morning at your office before you start work? Just thinking about it makes me smile. Looking forward to spending some time together.

Sending you lots of hugs and love,

Mr Bestie, 😘❤️❤️❤️",,

The best part of my day was definitely the intimate time we spent together this morning. You looked absolutely adorable in your work attire, just like our first date. 💖 The moments we shared were beautiful and passionate, making me feel so connected to you.

I hit the gym hard today and earned a silver medal for leg day! 🥈 Just missed the gold, but I’m still happy with my performance.

Work was surprisingly smooth. I completed a task that seemed daunting at first but delivered by the end of the day.

Had a good chat with Marilyn when she came by to pick up Levi from school. I told her about the reduced the nanny hours, and although she was a bit anxious, I feel confident it’s the right step for us. Levi’s going to adapt just fine. 😊

I indulged in some self-care by cooking Palak Paneer tonight. It’s one of my favourites and super healthy too. Cooking always helps me unwind.

Can’t wait to spend more time with you on our drive to work in the morning. 😘

Love you lots,

My clients were all really interesting today . One with bipolar has become manic so was able to draw on my medical knowledge to help guide her.

What a day! Working at your place was the best. Loved making brunch with you - and love ❤️ (we make a great team in so many ways).  Those sautéing leeks and mushrooms were not the only thing that sizzled 🙊 You are so hot and sexy! Just like our perfectly set  omelette - our intimate lunchtime escapade … just perfect.👌🏻 😈 🔥

Levi came home a bit down, but he cheered up with some Jenga and home made nuggets . For my dinner, I got creative - cooked a porterhouse steak from MeatSmith, roasted Greek lemon potatoes, and made homemade gravy. Quite the feast! 🥩🍋

Feeling a bit flat tonight, probably because of the busy week at the gym and my ADHD meds come down. Planning to take it easy tonight, enjoying a quiet evening with Levi, and aiming for an early night.

Can't wait for more moments like today. Love you more than words can say. 😘❤️

Tried to relax and do some admin work, but our lovely neighbor decided it was the perfect time to use power tools. 😂 

Managed to sneak out  and took Muffin for a groom, and she’s looking fabulous. Planning to take her for a nice long walk tomorrow. 🐶🚶‍♂️

Took Levi to the doctor late this afternoon- he woke up at 3pm! Got him some antibiotics and chocolate 🍫 , and he’s on the mend now. Poor little guy, but he’s such a trooper. 💪🧒🏼

Made him dinner tonight – homemade pesto and spiral pasta, and some refried lemon roast potatoes from last night. He loved it! Seeing him enjoy the meal after a tough time was the best part. 

Got a lovely text from Ben, Marcels oldest son, inviting us to a family get-together next Sunday afternoon. Would love for you to join us if you’re free - they have been wanting to meet you. Lets discuss more when we talk next…😊

Missed you today, and I’m down we didn’t get to spend time together - our first Saturday ever where we haven’t seen each other since we met perhaps? Our brief phone call was great, but it’s just not the same. Can’t wait to see you soon. ❤️

Thanks for your text- good to hear Levi is starting to feel a bit better - antibiotics and Didsy - Love should do the trick! 
Did lots of little jobs today that have been put off for a while - keys cut, a number for front door to help postie find our door amongst the confusing multitude of doors in this complex … also hope you don’t mind I got a dress too - can’t wait to show you - in fact I got 2 dresses cause I couldn’t decide! I will gladly go again with you as I’m updating my wardrobe and I love clothes as a form of self expression…
Nici and her bichone frise Teddy popped in much to Gibsons disdain..He prefers to be number one!
Catching up on reading for my course now - I have sex coming out of my ears - not the usual Saturday night practical application version - just theory tonight lol. 😂
Said I would do an EMDR session via zoom with Michelle tonight - usually would say no but she can’t afford therapy so I’m bending the rules a bit. 
Thanks bestie ❤️for inviting me next Sunday - looking forward to meeting the other side of Romy’s family.

We are both so aware of being accessible, responsive and engaged towards each other and that’s why our sex is so thrilling.  So thank you for your effort and that’s all we need to do for the amazing sex to keep going … easy! 

This is really different to what ester perel says - she says you need distance to create desire but Johnson says the closer you get to someone the more desire. She also says that the closer you are with someone the more oxytocin and oxytocin shuts down the habituation part of the brain which is what kills eroticism , not familiarity.

All this makes so much sense to me as to why our sex is so playful, fun, sensational! 

You truely are the sexiest man I have ever met and the pleasure from our lovemaking is beyond words.

Today was one of those rare, super quiet Sundays. No big plans, just me and Levi chilling at home. I started the day early with that Sue Johnson podcast you sent me last night. It was amazing! I texted you my thoughts earlier, but I have to say again how much I love our secure connection!

In the morning, Levi and I spent some time photographing his Osmo educational iPad game that he’s been wanting to sell to make some money.

For lunch, Levi, in his pyjamas, and I went to his favourite Italian spot, Etto. Spaghetti bolognese, of course. Then we walked to the health food shop, got some groceries, and picked up a few carob Banjo Bears treats. We spent the afternoon cooking fresh pappardelle pasta together -Levi was so into it, hanging the pasta ribbons out to dry was his favourite part.

I also tried baking a ginger fluff cake. Let’s just say it wasn’t as fluffy as I hoped. Over-whipped the egg whites... rookie mistake. Need to research that a bit more. But hey, practice makes perfect, right? 😂 I have already promised to bake two cakes, better brush up on my baking skills. 😎 

To alleviate the rising tensions of baking fails 😂, we took Muffin to Scape Goat park, and she had a blast running around. When we got back, I cooked a delicious dinner: salmon with fresh pappardelle and cream sauce. Levi devoured it, and I have to admit, it was pretty 😋 

Muffin's new AirTag  was discovered in the mailbox by Levi. She's looking adorable and now I won’t lose her... or her cuteness! 😊 

I also had a lovely chat with Marilyn. She's finally getting better and sounded so much more upbeat as she was leaving the house for the first time in days.

All in all, it was a fulfilling day. Quiet but productive. Spending time with Levi, cooking, and enjoying the simple things made it special.

I hope your day was amazing too. Can't wait to hear all about it. Let's keep dancing together, my love. ❤️💃🕺🏽

Sounds like a lovely day of baking,cooking, eating and Levi bonding ... 
my day was pretty chill - started with a big long walk and a coffee- the walk was way too long for Teaspoon who later could barely walk as her legs were all stiff - shorter walk for my elderly doggie next time!
Met my basketball mum friend Ariel in the park which was nice.
Then home to finally pack up all the cardboard boxes for rubbish collection this week - Zach was pretty helpful carrying them out to the front which was great to see. 
I spent some time setting up the blog  around loss and love that I think I mentioned to you - we have over a 100 pages of content to gradually upload  which has been created over years. AI was amazing at creating the website ! 
Ended the day stocking up on eggs as requested by z as he is worried with this bird flu outbreak that an egg shortage may get in the way of his protein intake! 
It was hard going not seeing my Bestie on the weekend… Miss you lots😘
Love your Bestie Xxx

If you are going to get the seafood ask the fish monger to prepare the squid to save us from messing around with it. Choose your favourite white fish but it can’t be too delicate - snapper, flat head, barramundi , ling have firm textures that hold up in a stew.

The highlight of my day was definitely reconnecting with you after our weekend apart. Reuniting with you again was absolutely wonderful. Our warm hug, kiss, and the walk to Harleston Park under the beautiful winter sun were perfect. ☀️ I loved hearing about your growth with your wave attachment style. I'm so proud of you, and it feels amazing to be part of that journey with you. ❤️

Picking up Levi from school together was heartwarming. He had such a blast playing on the swing while we chatted - it felt like he really enjoyed being in our company.  

When we got home, he  asked, 'Something's different, what's changed?' Lol we don’t live in filth anymore son.   It felt great seeing all my hard work pay off and making a big difference. 🏠 🧽 ❤️ 

I'm so grateful for the meaningful moments we share and the progress we're making together. Can't wait to see you again on Wednesday. Miss you already! (There I said it 😜)

I wanted to let you know about something, while cleaning the floor boards, I accidentally spilled a bottle of bleach and ended up inhaling quite a bit of it when cleaning it up. Last night, I felt quite sick with chills and a sore throat and an awful sleep. 

Today, I've been trying to flush out the toxins by staying hydrated and getting plenty of fresh air with the balcony door open . I'm still feeling a bit off today with more chills, so I might take it easy and rest up.

Is this a normal reaction to chemical exposure?

Just wanted to keep you in the loop. Hope you're having a good day.

Today has been a rollercoaster! I'm suspecting either a sudden bug or maybe chemical exposure to bleach 🤔. But reaching out to you was the best decision – your caring and responsive messages and phone call really lifted my spirits. Thank you for being my rock 💖. 

On my back in bed I got a win in negotiating a better interest rate with the my bank and home loan – saving $1500 a year! 💰.Oh, and I found some Captain Underpants book collection for Levi on Gumtree for $25, and his happiness was priceless 😁. haha not even feeling under the weather can slow the Dexies down.

Driving across the city for my therapist appointment was a nightmare in heavy traffic 🚗, but I just made it through with some Panadol. Still counting down the days until I don’t have to do that anymore

Levi gave me the biggest cuddle when I got home – it was so heartwarming 🥰.
Muffin kept me company today too, especially while I was resting on the couch. Practicing some self-care by lying in the sun’s warmth helped ease some of my discomfort.

Missing you… hopefully I will get through tonight okay? And I’ll wake up tomorrow feeling better. Would really like to see you at the office at 8:20 am tomorrow. I’ll text you in the morning and let you know if I’m coming. xx",,

“Whatta” that you are still not feeling great- only time will tell if it’s a bug vs bleach . My scientific mind though thinks if it was bleach you would have felt sick straight away  after mopping the floors and you were ok I think ? when I saw you on Monday … 
 I love you so much …It’s true, I am here for you bestie… 

I’m glad I got to chat quickly with you in the lunch break - I was genuinely worried you were not ok.. 

Sex therapy was interesting again today the most notable thing being that ester perel s book mating in captivity and her idea that distance helps with desire is now an outdated idea that has no evidence to back it. So our intuition was right, knowing safety and closeness is actually highly correlated with great sex .  Another interesting fact: Couples who Cuddle after sex  are more likely to maintain great sex lives. That’s us! 🥰

I’m glad your dexies kept you afloat and even efficient today and that you got a great big hug from Levi - so sweet you two. 

I sent out my 50 th invite last night and 7 out of 9 women rsvped with lovely emails that they will be there…yay! 
Still waiting on 2 … 

Zachs shoes arrived yesterday and we had some nice bonding as he asked me to help him put together the Nike boxes which came flat packed . Now I’m in on his escapades too! 

Rest up B’y - yes let me know how you are in the morning .

I wanted to let you know that my sore throat is still bothering me this morning, and I think I picked up an infection on Monday. It's strange since it coincided with my cleaning with bleach, but after seeing you on Monday, I did more cleaning at home and thought it was just that. However, it seems like it’s actually a virus. The shivers are gone, but I had another rough night’s sleep, and my throat is still very sore.

It’s frustrating because I’ve missed seeing you. However, when we reunited Monday, it showed me that our love is very strong despite the little hiccups that we have faced along the way. I’m hopeful that being healthy and fit will help me recover quickly this time. I’ll keep you updated on my progress.

I’m starting to feel better. Marilyn came over this afternoon, as she always does on Wednesdays. She brought some chicken soup, matzo balls, and other goodies for Levi, which is great. She’s picking him up from school now.

I’ve had a relatively easy day - just taking some meetings and lying in bed, crossing off a few more tasks. I took it easy and skipped the gym and went for a quick walk with Muffin - after dropping Levi at school to get some fresh air.

It’s another beautiful day, and I’ve enjoyed having the sun streaming in. I hope your sessions went well today and you making the most of the weather.

Thanks for your message! So happy to hear you had a good day and got to enjoy some trumpet time 🎺🤩. Z sounds super dedicated with his first aid course -that's impressive! 

Today was all about rest and recovery. I stayed home to kick my throat infection to the curb with litres of licorice root tea, but Levi’s massive cuddle after school was the real medicine I needed. He jumped on me again like a little koala 🐨, and it made my heart burst with happiness and love.

Work was surprisingly good. Even though I felt crummy, my team respected my input and quickly adopted my strategy for solving some technical issues. Felt like a bit of a superhero in my holey thermals 😂 

Levi made me so proud today. He’s devouring his new Captain Underpants books like there's no tomorrow. Halfway through one of them on the way home from purchasing them and then finished another shortly after -my  little bookworm 🐛.

I miss you too, more than words can say. I'll definitely let you know if I need anything tomorrow, but just knowing you're there for me is already everything. I’m actually feeling much better and I think I’ll be okay tomorrow - perhaps I’ll skip going into the city but if you’re around in the afternoon on the way back let me know and let’s catch up outside and get some fresh air together?

Thanks so much for your understanding about our mix-up today. I woke up feeling great again and then realised how much catch-up I have to do before the end of the week. I kind of went into frantic mode, skim-read your text, and thought, 'Ooh, Melanie wants to see me, and she's coming at four….Yay!'

I'm also sorry to hear you had a bit of a triggering session that became quite tricky for you. I can definitely see where you're coming from, and I hope you'll be able to speak to your supervisor soon because I'd hate to see you triggered every week. Let me know how that pans out.

Anyway, Levi's about to have his Junior Soiree now at 6:30pm, which will be a welcome change of pace. I'll wind down afterward and can't wait to see you tomorrow morning at 8:30 and spend some time with you - even if  it will be small snippets of cuddles, kisses and lovingly prepared omelettes 😋 ❤️🥚 🥚 🥚 🥚❤️

Love you too. xx",,

Hope you got through the soirée ok? I remember fondly those nights .
Yeah I was upset today yet also proud of myself as I went straight to expressing myself in a vulnerable way rather than anger or blame - that’s good communication! And I was regulated enough to hear your explanation. Hope it felt ok on the receiving end. 


Guess what? I got the job with the group of surgeons !  I’m pretty surprised given I have no experience in the area - now I will have a new interest in psychology to pursue yay. 

Love you and can’t wait to see you tomorrow and give you a great hug hug 🤗 😘❤️",,

Our work date was a highlight today . That passionate greeting at the door? Totally made my day.l! Spending quality time with you, working and chatting, was just perfect. And I loved being your private chef. 🧑‍🍳 🥰

The drive to Geelong with Levi was filled with his reading adventures. Though, we had a little challenge when we arrived because he was a bit hungry—might’ve been the GP visit that threw off his lunch schedule. But we turned it around with a lovely dinner at the Wharf Shed. I had a delicious porterhouse steak with steamed veggies, and Levi had his mini margherita pizza. He was thrilled to steal my chips and I didn’t mind—cheeky monkey! 🍕🍟 🧒🏼

We brought Muffin along and she loved the beach walk. Even managed to sneak her into the restaurant in her special carry bag. She’s quite the little adventurer 🐶.

After this rollercoaster of a week, ending the day relaxing in the hotel room, watching a cooking show (filmed in Barcelona!), and thinking about calling you later tonight to say good night. 😘

I've been thinking about all the amazing moments we've shared last month, and I just had to tell you how grateful I am for you. From our cozy sleepovers and delicious meals we cooked together to the beautiful walks and deep conversations we've had, every moment with you has been truly special. 

Attending the Missy Higgins concert with you, meeting your parents again, and planning our future travels together have all made me realize how lucky I am to have you in my life. Your support during my ADHD treatment and your unwavering presence when I am sick mean the world to me. 

I love how we find joy in the little things, like exploring new cafes, drives, and simply being together. Your warmth, love, and understanding make every day brighter. I can't wait to see what this month brings us. So exciting. 

Love Nathan ❤️",,

Thanks for your sweet message.
I too am so incredibly grateful for you. You woke me up from a deep slumber and continue to do so every day.  With you by my side everything looks so much brighter.
The world looks like a place to explore and enjoy and I’m so excited to do it with you. 
You are a rare gem and to think I went fossicking not knowing what or who or when and then I found you is one of the most brightest outcomes of my life. 
I was remembering the other day that I saw you in my minds eye before I even met you … it’s so strange yet so lovely and confirming to me that we were destined to meet❤️
Lots of love xx 
Your sweet Melanie ❤️❤️😘😘

I’ve been feeling great all morning too until I started baking and my egg whites collapsed again. I became a bit stressed but I discovered a trick to bring them back by adding another egg white, and I made them stiff again! I guess my sponges just needed a little baking Viagra. 😂 There's this sweet spot where they go from soapy looking to soft and firm, then stiff, and there's a small window where they stay stiff before they collapse. I think the science behind it is very fascinating! 📚🔬 I’m waiting for them to cool now so I can put the whipped cream, strawberry, and raspberry jam in the middle and make a delicious spongy sandwich. 🍓🍰 

Levi is excited! 🎉 But I have no appetite… 🤷

Work's a bit stressful with deadlines and Levi is with me today, but the good news is Scouts is canceled tonight. Just need to schlep to Richmond later.

I’m excited we can put the money down for the deposit! I’ve started a spreadsheet to track our spending. I'll send it over to you later.
Glad my silliness has carried through to your day and made you smile. There must be tons of categories for an affair. But don’t worry, you’ll never need to bust out your detective skills with me. Our biggest mystery will be figuring out where all our odds socks disappear to! Hope you are doing okay today in your course workshop. Jokes aside there is an underlying hurt for you.

1- Pay deposit of $335.90 NZ  by 4 days time.( I can organise this for now)

The cold and blustery weather set the mood and tone for the morning, but I managed to spend an hour on my online course while Levi was busy writing stories on his iPad. Then I had to juggle work meetings with a headache and brain fog, but I managed to power through 😵‍💫💪.

Guess what? The cake was a hit! Didn't have to throw it out after all. Marilyn and Simi enjoyed it for afternoon tea when they visited, and they even asked to take some home with them 🎂😋. It was nice to have some family time.

In the evening, I took Levi to Officeworks to print photos for his Scout Badge project and picked up my ADHD meds refill—they only cost 12 bucks a bottle! Helping Levi with his mushroom project for Scouts was such a great bonding dad moment 🍄.

I'm really excited about our trip and that we are  putting a deposit down! I’ve sent you our holiday spending tracking spreadsheet. I'll make a payment to your account-  give you some money for what we’ve spent so far. Can't wait for our adventure together! 💕

And can’t wait to see you in the morning. I’m so excited! 😘😘🤗🤗.

Love you always and sweet dreams my love,
Besty ❤️",,

Cooked a roast chicken for dinner, and even Muffin got to share some! 🐶🍗 And my new electric blanket arrived from Kogan, making this cold winters night so much cozier 🌬️🛌.

Levi’s creativity is shining as always; he finished an amazing drawing of a maze that my poor end of day tired brain struggled to find its way out of. 😵‍💫

Sending you all my love and more tongue action next time we meet 😉😘.

Hi sweet Nathan 
Hope the rest of your day went well . I had a bit of a mishap tonight 😢- when Jemma and Lara were here Gibson stole some chicken and as I tried to get a bone out his mouth he clamped down on one of my fingers - it was sooooo painful and now it is swollen and numb - think it should be fine but was very hard to be present for a while . 
Miss you lots.
Goodnight best one 😘😘❤️❤️",,

How was your day?
I caught up on lots of jobs that needed doing including cooking and cleaning. 
At last I got around to taking little Teaspoon for a bath and she had what’s called a “ dryer seizure” - she started screaming when the dryer went close to her ear and thrashing around - the poor thing - I think that may have happened at the groomers and that’s why she wasn’t allowed back . I just held her till she calmed and now she is ok. 
Thinking of you lots and missing you heaps.
I love you 😘 ❤️😘❤️😘

I've had a much-needed day at home by myself after the busy Jewish holidays and long weekend with Levi. It's been so refreshing to have my own space, sit down at my computer, and get some uninterrupted work done. I even spent some time cooking this afternoon. 🧑‍🍳 I roasted a chicken and made 4 litres of homemade chicken stock!

Dassi picked up Levi from school and will drop him back around 7, so I've had a full day of calm—just what I needed. I haven't even left the house today or gone to the gym.

Although, alongside all this, there's a slight pang of pining and wanting you. The connection we have had last week and over the weekend is so strong, and it's tough when you're not around to give you a hug or kiss, or just look at you and think, oh, she's my sweet Melanie, I'm so lucky!!!

I'm looking forward to tomorrow when I'll dive back into the world again with the gym, scouts, and driving to the north side for all the fun chaos. 🌟

P.S. Good job getting that sweet, stinky mutt groomed. Can't wait to give her a big pat soon. And I hope Gibson's been a good boy and gave you lots of cuddles after he hurt your finger. 😘😘😘😘👧🏻",,

it looks like Zach is going to his grandparents tomorrow night for dinner so I wondered if it might perhaps be an opportunity for you and Levi to pop in.. maybe after dinner for dessert ( choc mint ice cream) and to meet Gibson and Teaspoon and maybe play a few games? I’m not sure time yet but probably from 6.30pm.

Levi and I would love to pop in for dinner on Saturday night for some dessert and to meet Gibson and Teaspoon. 🍨🍫 We can be there around 6.30pm?

I was thinking I could bring some homemade fresh pasta and a ragu sauce. It's hard to find stuff Levi likes for takeaway unless it's chicken nuggets from Grill'd, but he definitely loves my home cooking. I know you do too! Maybe I could also bring some salmon or pesto to go with the pasta? Let me know what you think.

Today has been super productive and energizing! I loved our meaningful conversations and kisses with you during our commute. Plus, Levi's been super creative, building a Paddle Pop house.

Looking forward to a cozy night in your little nest, filled with games, ice cream, and love. 🏡❤️

Lots of love and kisses,

I’ve got dinner covered tonight. 🍝 I’ve been spending a bit of time in the kitchen. Today I’ve made some more fresh pasta, and I’m doing a smoky eggplant pasta dish with toasted walnuts and buffalo mozzarella cheese for you. Sounds delicious, right? 😋

Levi and I have also prepared lamb shank ragu to go with the pappardelle pasta we’ve made. So yeah, we’ll just bring it around. We’ll just need to cook up the pasta in a big pot and we can heat up the sauces in the microwave. It shouldn’t be a big deal to cook dinner tonight.

Let me know if you’ve got any ideas for dessert. Otherwise, we’ll pick up some ice cream on the way through. 🍦 Let us know what time we can see you. Can’t wait to spend some time with you. I hope you’ve been having a good day and you got a good rest last night. 🌸

Thanks so much for preparing dinner - it does sound delicious 😋! I am so grateful for your love of 🧑‍🍳 cooking 😘
I will be going out to drop Zach at a friend at 4.30 so will pick up Wills Batch then - I also made a fruit salad for us.  A pot of boiling water shall be waiting for you…
I’m going to take Gib for a big run when I go out at 4.30 to help settle him for tonight. 
Zach is going straight to Paul’s place from his friend so I will be free earlier than I thought … any time from 5.45 is good.
Can’t wait to see you bestie and spend some more time with little bestie too. 
A few things before I forget :
I will give Levi his little gift to take with him tonight as tomorrow might be a bit rushed  and that way he can open it  when he leaves so no pressure if he doesn’t connect with it ! 
And if you think it’s ok, could I please have Marilyn’s phone number so I can text her to let her know I am thinking of her and Henry on Monday . 
Thanks Bestie.

I just wanted to take a moment to express how incredibly grateful I am for you. Today was such a special day, and having you by my side made it all the more meaningful. You looked absolutely gorgeous, and I was so proud to introduce you to everyone. Your dress perfectly encapsulated your quirky and creative side, which I love so much. Your support, from engaging with Levi last night to carrying it through today, has been wonderful. Everything about it is just wonderful. It was so lovely to decompress with you later, snuggling in the back of the movie theater. The gentle touch of your hand and the constant stroking with your thumb really soothed me. When you wrapped your arms around me and I placed my head on yours, it felt so comforting - just like when I did on your shoulder  at the party. It's amazing how we are becoming more comfortable being intimate around others, in family settings, and around Levi. It all feels so natural, real, and just right. I'm so lucky that everything has fallen into place with you this year. It's been a wonderful 50th year for me and I just know yours will be too.

Thank you for everything, Bestie. I love you so much.

Hey Bestie,

I had another incredibly productive day today. I had so much fun at the gym in a boxing session. I'm really getting into the left-left rights. 🥊 My digital piano arrived today, and it weighed a ton. I had to get my friend Simon to come around tonight (you met him at the morning tea). He helped me lift it onto the stand after I constructed it - I am going to give my old one to his son - not sure if it has any market value given its age and the fact that it is obsolete. It's an absolutely gorgeous piano. My old —you could hear the plasticky sounds when I played. But this one's got proper real wooden keys and feels like I'm playing a real acoustic piano. It's incredible! The technology is amazing, and it sounds fantastic. Levi never ceases to amaze me how intelligent he is. He picked up all the buttons and features without even reading the manual. It's incredible how kids these days just get technology straight away. Both of us are like kids at Christmas - and perhaps like couple of siblings fighting over who wants to play with it first.  😜 I'm pretty exhausted now, so I think I'm going to call it a night. It's been a very busy time lately, and I cannot wait to get to Bright and just be in our own space. It’s going to be a very special weekend away... 🥰 

Chats and kisses in the morning,
Beastie 💪🏻 😘👧🏻",,

Her analytical charm set my heart ablaze.

As two slugs appeared, her mind at play,
She quipped , “Slug, slug, slug, slug, slug,” in a mischievous array.

Then near the winter vineyard, under the Australian sky,
A polar bear she glimpsed and grizzlies wandering by.

Yet despite the magical beasts to explore,
She repeatedly proclaimed , “I feel nothing,” “I feel nothing” … then took more.

There were indeed  highs, and a low, to a peaceful rest,
Until her slumber arrived on my beating chest.

Every moment was so precious, in the calm of that night,
And as gentle rain fell, I held her so tight.

Love you 🥰 ",,

Besty I have your beanie so don’t fret… meant to text you sooner to let you know your beanie is not lost but been an unexpected afternoon with Teaspoon falling unwell - it looked very worrying initially… like she had a stroke - she still can’t walk or stand up . Vet said even though it looks pretty dramatic it is most likely to be geriatric vestibular syndrome which she will hopefully recover from over next 3 days. Poor doggy 🐶 she is miserable and so sleepy .

It was a pleasure as always to spend time with your little man. He has such a sweet smile. 😊 

The movie was quite incredible… such sophisticated concepts made into a creative and entertaining two hour burst that had me in tears by the end. 

A few little things before I forget:
- I have your sunnies , forgot to give you them today.
- don’t forget to cancel NZ hotels we don’t need.
- Abi can’t look after Gib on Sunday - do you think your mum’s dog sitter lady might be interested in an afternoon of work? 

Miss you and love you lots and lots 😘 😘😘❤️❤️❤️",,

Yay, great! Although it hasn't been sunny lately, I knew my sunnies were safe with you, so thank you for looking after them. I've already canceled a few more NZ hotels, so we're making good progress.

As for Gibby on Sunday, Mum's dog sitter is more into house swaps, so I reached out to Annette, our other dog sitter. Although she couldn't take on both dogs last time, she might be interested in having just one for the afternoon. I've sent her a text, so let's see what she says.

Tomorrow, I'm looking forward to driving out to Geelong and spending the day with Pepper. There's a freeze on work releases for the next week or so, so it's very quiet at work again, which is a nice change of pace.

On Thursday morning, Marcel is taking Levi to the circus, but he wanted me to drop him off in Richmond near the circus. I told him I couldn't do that, but he could possibly pick Levi up at my work. So, would it be okay if Levi and I book in Busbabe for a love shuttle down Punt Road to work on Thursday morning? Levi is excited about going to work with me and then heading to the circus. What an exciting day! He just said, 'Not bad.'

I really enjoyed our long embrace today at the gym. I didn't want to let you go. It's been a bit of a tough week with limited opportunity for us to spend time with each other. Let's plan something ASAP so we have something to look forward to.

Miss you so much and love you more than words can say 😘😘😘❤️❤️❤️

Thanks so much for contacting Annette - we had a lovely chat and she will be able to look after Gibson on Sunday afternoon. 😊

Bus babe has an early Punt road shuttle running on Thursday morning as there is a 9 am client  and a need to factor in time for the far away car park and the walk that goes with that . The Gordon Street stop would be at 7.15/20 … does that work? 

Have a great day with your beautiful Pepper.

Thanks for your shoulder to cry on and reassurance that this wave really needs. 
This is an example of where you seem to be able to respond to what I don’t actually speak up with yet you somehow know. 

So here it is what I didn’t actually say … Part of my sadness is the shame I feel in wanting to see you more,and not being able to voice that.  I know the school holidays are hard and there is no time but it’s more than that - it definitely triggers my fear of abandonment… 
So yeah part of it is grief and sadness but part of it was my wave- ness rearing up … and then I felt really manipulative by only telling you about the grief part of my sadness and not the abandonment part . 

Anyway there it is in full  and raw vulnerability as I vow not to suppress things any more . 

Thanks for understanding.
It took me a bit of reflecting to work out what was going on but wanted to share it with you.  I know it’s a pattern - I’ve done it before with you - I put weight on being upset about other stuff and don’t actually voice something else ( usually wave related) then feel like a phoney  and dishonest . 

But I’m glad I shared honestly with you this time xx

Thank you for sharing this with me. I’m really glad you did, and I appreciate your honesty and vulnerability. I want you to know that it’s okay to feel what you’re feeling and to express it. You never have to worry about being manipulative or dishonest with me – your feelings are valid, and I’m here to support you through all of them.

I understand how the school holidays can be tough and how it might bring up those fears. I promise that I’m not going anywhere, and we’ll get back into our routine next week. I can’t wait for that either.

You are so important to me, and I value every moment we get to spend together. If you ever feel this way again, please don’t hesitate to tell me. We’ll navigate it together.

Sending you a big hug. Can’t wait to see you soon.

How are you? I’ve had a bit of a wind-down day after a very busy week. I spent some time cleaning out the laundry, took Levi out to lunch on Glenhuntly Road for some Japanese, and then took Muffin for a walk around the park. Levi has been playing the piano a lot with his headphones on while I caught up on some much-needed rest.

I’m really excited about having some quality time with you tonight. I’m curious about your plans and can’t wait to find out what you have in store for us. I’ll be dropping Levi off at 5 PM and am looking forward to seeing you right after that.

Thank you so much for popping around this morning. Your company, the Panadol, and our good chats were exactlly what I needed. And I loved our healthy debrief over last night’s hit and miss date. It’s amazing how open and understanding we are with each other, embracing all our quirky ways. Let’s keep that going and think about how we can mitigate the feelings of detachment next school holidays. We’ll be good. We’ll work it all out.

All I know is that I want you in my life forever. I treasure us so much and I’m never going to let you go.

Enjoy the scones with your lovely friends. I’m sorry I can’t make it today, but it’s wonderful how you’ve chosen to celebrate your 50th birthday this year. I think it’s going to be a lovely way to round out your celebrations.

Looking forward to hearing all about it. Let’s have a phone call tonight.

😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘👧🏻",,

How are you feeling? 
Your scones were a hit with at least 2 of my friends asking me to tell you they were delicious. 
I’m so glad I had this celebration- they stayed till 5 pm!! It was a heartwarming afternoon seeing everyone enjoy themselves. We ended up all sitting squished around the table and Terri suggested everyone say something about me - it was pretty full on but gosh I feel loved . There were tears and laughter 😂 .  I am so grateful for them.

It’s always my pleasure to care for you when you are not feeling well .  It was very sweet too when I popped into Marilyn for the lift that didn’t eventuate and Levi was so relaxed and excited to show me his Mario and Luigi .  

Our chat this morning is testimony to the strength of our relationship. We are both blessed with empathy, understanding of relationships and the language to, in a non blaming way, communicate to each other. 
Most couplings will have either a wave or island or both so it’s not unique in any way that we are going to again and again feel too smothered or too much distance.  What is unique is our awesome repair - that’s all that really matters …if we can both own our insecurities, worries and doubts this relationship will last forever. 
Thank you for the language you used ( you have clearly been to the school of language for men who date waves) in your text. “Forever” in relation to us is a word that I treasure and that reassures my crazy little nervous system.  You are a beautiful man, with a willing and kind heart and there is no way I’d ever let you go no matter how many island/ wave incidents we need to ride through together . 
You are the most precious man to me - I will never stop working on me and us. 
Plus you make amazingly light and fluffy scones !! ( I ate one!) 
I hope you are feeling better. Let me know if you need any help. 
All my love xxxx ❤️❤️",,

Thanks for the update about your party! It sounds like it was a blast. It’s great that you had such a good time and that everything went smoothly. Sounds like you’re on a real high after the occasion. I’m so happy for you. It must have been lovely having all that love around you.

As for me, I’ve been feeling a bit crap with a sore throat and some fatigue. Managed to muster up the energy to wash my sheets and, while I was at it, harvested my shiitake mushrooms. I made a delicious mushroom soup with some leftover onion, dried porcini mushrooms, sage, and garlic. Shiitake mushrooms, rich in beta-glucans,  are great for the immune system, so I’m hoping that’ll help me feel better soon.

Spent the afternoon resting in bed and was fascinated by the news about the Donald Trump assassination attempt, so I tuned into that a bit on Twitter. Levi just got back at five, so it’s been a decent day of alone time despite feeling sick. Hoping it’s just a cold I picked up from the gym on Friday and that I’ll be back on track soon. So glad the school holidays are now over so we can get back into a routine!

I didn't have the best night last night; it took me a while to fall asleep. But on the positive side, it was raining for most of the night, so I opened up the doors, turned on the electric blanket, and put on a beanie. Falling asleep to the sound of rain made me feel like I was on a camping trip. It was so nice having the warmth on my body and the cool, icy air on my face. The fresh air did me good, and I ended up waking up at 7 instead of 4, even though I fell asleep around 1 or 1:30.

After waking up this morning, my medication is great because I now feel it works like an old-school codral. I'm ready to start my day and don't feel blocked up. Today, I'm staying home again to maximise rest, and I have my therapy session remotely, which I'm looking forward to. There's plenty of work to keep me busy. Levi's been amazing getting off to school—he's so enthusiastic and even made his bed again. It's natural that he starts off the term with enthusiasm and gets a bit tired towards the end.

I loved our phone call last night. It really helps. Even though we live so close, it sometimes feels like we're worlds apart. Can't wait to see you soon. Love you so much. xxx",,

I’m sorry sleep didn’t come easy for you but the sound of raindrops and cool breeze against your warm bed sounds very comforting. Wish I could give you a big comforting hug too. 

That’s great that Levi is so enthusiastic about school - bit different to Zach who had his first day back this morning- he struggled to get up after sleeping in till 11 most days. But it was great to be back in the car with him and see our funny banter return - those lifts are so important to us connecting… it’s really the only time we do.

I feel so much better than last week - so much of it is hormonal - it always feels like a dark cloak has been lifted - such relief- as soon as that week of pms/ period passes. It affects me so much after having it under control for so many years by using the pill which I can no  longer take. Everything just looks brighter again. 

In other news….Michelle is coming to Melbourne for a funeral  on Wednesday until Monday … she might stay with me for a bit. 

Off to the dentist - let me know if you need any groceries while I’m out and about or if I can help in any other way. 

I love you soooo much bestie and can’t wait to hug you really tight xxxx 😘😘🤗🤗",,
Melanie,2024-07-16 17:18:14,,,,iMessage,Outgoing,,,Delivered,,,"Hey Bestie,

Thank you for the sweet message. I really needed it after a rough night. The sound of raindrops and the cool breeze were indeed comforting, but your hugs would be much better.

It’s so nice to hear about your car rides with Zach. Those moments are truly precious and it’s great that you get to share those funny, connecting moments together. It’s amazing how much those little things matter. I enjoy my little walks to school with Levi.

I’m really glad to hear you’re feeling better this week. Hormonal shifts must be tough - another reason why I find women so fascinating.  It must be such a relief to have that brightness back. However, I love all sides to you and feel safe around you which ever Melanie you bring to me.

Thanks for the update about Michelle. I hope to see her, even if it’s under sad circumstances for her. Having her stay with you will be really great for you and Zach too!

I don’t think we need any groceries right now, but thank you for offering. I have been defrosting my chicken soup and I'll do the same for Levis meat sauce tonight. 

I managed to sit upright today lol and I delivered some work so I am finishing my day off feeling accomplished.

I can’t wait to hug you tight and hold you close. Can I see you tomorrow before work starts?

I had a busy day with 5 clients - my first one you let through the door for me and she told me “ one of your colleagues let me in” lol you must pass for a psychologist 👨‍⚕️ 

Then bus babe transformed into mum taxi for a bit before going to Abi who insisted on making me her famous Japanese style salmon and rice- it was very delicious.

Seeing you this morning truly brightened my day. Even though I've stayed home since, the joy from our time together has lingered. I'm still battling this blocked head and the return of the nasal congestion now that my medication has worn off. Tomorrow might be another challenge, but I'll take it one step at a time.

Despite the physical discomfort, I had a productive day at work. I took on a leadership role to ensure the delivery went smoothly, even with the added pressure from the delivery manager. However, I'm starting to feel a bit down because I haven't been out for walks or to the gym. I realize I need to focus on some self-care tomorrow, rather than just staring at a laptop or lying in bed all day.

I miss you and our time together. This morning was wonderful, especially when I rested my head on your chest and heard your heartbeat racing. It was such a comforting and special moment. I saw your next client come in and wondered if they were for your next session, but it was nice to feel like a part of your day. Guess I can pass as a psychologist, right?

Maybe we can meet up when you come back to the south side tomorrow. I don’t know when you’re finishing, but I have time to myself right up to the end of the day since Jan is looking after Levi.

Much Love,

Thank you so much for cooking us a delicious meal last night, for sleeping so soundly next to me and rotating plates with me over brunch. Thank you for playing your tuneful tunes as I showered away the leftovers of our lovemaking .  Your music makes me feel and notice how life is so different now. I didn’t used to have a sweet sexy man creatively playing a piano in my lounge room . Thank you for being my winter sunshine☀️ and for your never ending catch up kisses. 😘 
I hope you got to enjoy the glimmers of actual sunshine today - I wished I was walking with you when I felt the sun on my skin. 

I finish work at 3 pm tomorrow and it would be my pleasure to drive you home should you be in the city at that time.
Love you lots Sweetman.

The rest of my day was peaceful. I poured my heart into the kitchen, picking up half a leg of lamb from Coles and creating a flavorful curry. I roasted cumin and cardamom, added cloves and cinnamon, and caramelized four onions for a touch of sweetness. A bit of Greek yogurt for a hint of sourness and slow-cooked it all to perfection. The baby spinach was blended into a rich, green gravy with tender lamb chunks and it turned out delicious. I can't wait to savor it throughout the week, getting a good dose of greens.

Tonight, I enjoyed the leftover dinner from last night with some greens and some more salmon, and it was just as delicious as yesterday 😋 . 

Spending time with you yesterday and last night was incredibly uplifting. After a week of feeling down and unwell, being with you rejuvenated me. The way we connect, without any distractions, just being together, talking, and sharing intimacy is beyond words. My love for you runs so deep, and I cherish every moment we spend together. Our friendship, our romantic connection, and our shared passions make my heart sing- and make me want to play your piano 🎹 🥰. I'm eagerly looking forward to seeing you more this week, and yes, I’d love for you to drive me home tomorrow. Thank you!

Sleep well tonight, my love. You are my everything, and I love you more than words can express. I’ll talk to you soon.

Good night, love you,
Sweetman 😘❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️",,

I got your email this morning  and wanted to thank you for your thoughtful response. I was so pleased with your feedback, and I really appreciate it. I took a closer look at our travel plans and compared the cost of flights on Thursday afternoon versus Friday morning. The Thursday afternoon flights are about $50 cheaper per person, so we'd save around $150 which would offset  the cost of the hotel on the first night. Considering this, I think it still makes sense flying on Thursday afternoon. This way, we can settle into the lovely Glebe Hotel, have a restful night, and wake up refreshed ready for our holiday. Especially since it will be a public holiday in Melbourne and the start of school holidays in New South Wales, making the Friday morning flights a bit pricier and busier.

Have a great day and looking forward to embracing you later in the day.

Love,
Besty 💕",,

If you get there before me feel free to come up to the warm waiting room on level 3 of 100 Victoria pde which is next door to the car park on salvation lane that I met you at last time.  Or I could pick you up if you prefer to stay at work.

For the first time in our beautiful relationship, I did find myself grappling with a fear of losing you. It has been unfamiliar in the context of us however no stranger in the context of my life.  The fear of loss is something that will always be a part of me. This fear of losing you was somewhat unsettling and something that only crept in over the last week - I believe in response to some  misattunement between us and possibly from the disruption of our routine over the past four weeks.  

Despite this fleeting fear, I am constantly reminded of how fortunate I am. Your mind, with its beautiful rumination and wonders, fascinates me endlessly. I believe I am very much sapiosexual, drawn and deeply attracted to your incredible intellect. But I am even luckier to have found all that and more in you - a woman with an incredibly stunning body and a heart of exceptional compassion, proven by even the most rigorous psychometric testing during the early states of our most beautiful courtship lol.  
You are the complete package for me, and I am endlessly grateful to be in a relationship with you. 

I want you to know that I accept and embrace you completely, even when you venture into the dimly lit spaces of your mind. In those moments, I may briefly feel fear, but when I approach you directly, I am utterly fearless. But you already know that. You understand the  profound sense of trust and safety we have cultivated together. The unspoken understanding that we can express ourselves openly and directly.

How cute and adorable that we quickly uncovered that our fears have been mutual. Through honesty and understanding, we have only strengthened our bond. Once again, we are filled with big hit of blissful oxytocin and reassured that, no matter what challenges life presents, we have what it takes to keep our love burning strong.💘💘💘",,

I wish I could protect you from the inevitable discomfort that crops up in relationships from time to time and put you in a bubble of joy - you have suffered enough. Yet through our mini sufferings we are growing closer and in that I take comfort as I hope you do too. 

Thank you so much for being so open with your thoughts and feelings - you may be sapiosexual … but is there a word for someone who is attracted to emotional intelligence? lol . That’s what I’m loving most  about you bestie. 

You too are the most uniquely perfect package for me - not only your emotional intelligence but your desire to connect and respect so deeply with your partner , your authenticity and creativity- a complete dream come true. Not to mention I too find you incredibly sexy. I still can’t believe how lucky I am to have discovered a shining needle in a haystack .

Your intuition is incredibly astute and attuned. I think your fear of losing me was an attuned response to my fear of losing you. Over the recent days after misinterpreting your distance on that Monday car journey I did ( incorrectly) start to worry about a diminution of our deep emotional bond when really that’s not what was happening… you just temporarily had something to deal with at work but meanwhile I was busy catastrophising in my head.  You must have somehow picked up on my fear I was losing you through my word choice … like when I mentioned I was afraid of boredom or missed the excitement … what I was really saying was “ I don’t want to lose your  emotional connection ever”    Now I understand why I was saying these things to you - I understand that it’s not the initial excitement I’m after it’s the connection. And in fact we are more connected than ever!  Yet I didn’t say that directly ( at the time wasn’t quite aware as I am now) and so I can see how when I expressed it as a fear of boredom or less excitement that would have sounded like I was checking out a bit … I see now how this became a misunderstanding and yes it is very sweet that we were both sitting with the same fear yet both wondering and misinterpreting  each others “ distance”. 
I love you , I love how you are so keen to examine our ups and downs and make sense of them with me.
Repair is a beautiful thing - it strengthens the tapestry of our love. 
Thank you so much bestie xx",,
Melanie,2024-07-28 20:03:32,2024-07-28 20:03:34,,,iMessage,Outgoing,,,Delivered,,,"My understanding of this quite modern term - which probably spawned from online dating culture, which is where I first discovered it - Is that emotional intelligence does indeed fall under the term of being sapiosexual. 

“An IQ test does not describe the parameters emotionally sapiosexuals seek in prospective partners. For the sapiosexual, intelligence is not a number. The ability for a person to have unique, incisive, deep, and inquisitive conversations is highly attractive. As a sapiosexual, you may also be physically attracted to someone, but if you later find out that the other person lacks curiosity, intellectual rigor, and open-mindedness, these things can be deal-breakers. When a person exhibits a general lack of awareness about the world, you may quickly feel let down and lose interest.”

We both easily fall under this categorisation and with this unique shared trait our connection and love for each other will always be strong.  Skinny, fat, old, wrinkled or whatever… NONE of that of that will ever matter in the end. Our depth, openness, curiosity and words will always be our bedrock.

“They say nothing lasts forever, but they haven’t seen us plan our next holiday. Or the way we get excited about every little detail. Just you, me, and our travel plans. Maybe some things, like our love for adventures, last forever after all.”

“I’ll fight for us, through thick and thin,
Reminding us our love will always win,
In our hearts, I’ll keep planting  seeds,
And a forever love will flourish and last forever after all.””

But they haven’t seen the tears made from love that fall down her face when she receives his words, they haven’t seen us exchange deep loving texts,  still nearly a year later, professing our adoration  and commitment we have for each other. Maybe some things  like exchanging beautiful words, last forever after all. 

They say nothing lasts forever
But they haven’t  seen us lock eyes each time we meet. They haven’t seen us care for each other when we are sick or down, they haven’t seen how he still made her birthday scones while his fever burned.  Nor did they see him bring her a mandarin when her energy waned. Maybe some things like our desire to care for each other last forever after all.  

They say nothing lasts forever
But they haven’t  seen us sit and sit with sun on our backs content just with each, just you and me.  They haven’t seen her daydreams of waking up next to him every day knowing that’s all she really wants. Maybe some things like the understanding of the preciousness of small moments together, last forever after all .

I didn’t think you could get any naughtier! You know I still can’t get you out of my mind. You were so very naughty at our last encounter. 🔥🔥🔥

With great pleasure, I demanded that you wear a sexy black slip and G-string - and it left me in awe of your awakened sexuality.

When I have the pleasure of seeing you next, undress for me, reveal your most sexy and naughty side. Show me with your eyes that you still want me to play with you.

Show me your submissive side again...

While we are still standing, I will let you kiss me as I finger your wet pussy, bringing you closer to the brink of your first orgasm.

I’ll pick you up and arrange you on my single couch on all fours. From behind, I will slap your bottom – just to remind you how very naughty you are.

I'll bend down so I can taste you, letting my tongue slide from your wet pussy all the way up to your rim... and back home again.

You will then be commanded to get on the floor. I will tease you with my massive, throbbing cock – thrusting it towards you just so you can briefly circle in on it with your tongue.

And then I will take it away from you again. 

Finally I will give in to your aching desires to worship my cock and take it all in with your mouth. Take the time to lock eyes with me – look up at me as I look down into your incredibly sexy eyes. 

Never stop circling it with your sexy tongue - as well as taking me in, tease me too. As I witness your insatiable appetite for hard cock - my hard cock, I will gently push your sexy dark hair behind your neck –  just so I can see all of your beautiful face.

You will then be picked up and rearranged on all fours on the floor. Present your wet pussy to me and let me tease you with my tip. 

I will slowly guide my way in... and begin gently thrusting. You will be so turned on, burning for more, I will begin to feel your pussy open up – preparing to take in all of me... because it knows what's cuming this time. 😉🍆🍆🍆

You will finally beg me to pick you up and throw you down. To spread your little legs wide open, to lock eyes with me and thrust deep into your primed perfect pussy… and fuck you just the way I know you like it.

Oh and level 6 is still waiting for you, if you so wish... 

Beastie 💞💞💞",,

I have been so so much naughtier though - fantasising about your massive cock and imagining submitting to your every whim . It is your birthday after all - so my gift to you is to go wherever your imagination might take you … no limits- my body is yours. And my body desires you so much that my wetness will allow us to go wherever we need to , to edges and precipices we have never explored before . 
Your words make me ache with desire.  I am  wet and desperate to have  you in control of my body to tease me and fuck me. 

level 6? Remind me beastie … does that mean I will have the pleasure of watching back  our nakedness  , my legs apart on all fours so I get so see your searching tongue on my wet pussy, to playback my tongue circling your massive cock as you tease me endlessly? I will see your manly behind desperately fucking me on your bed as we finally get to cum .  Oh yes please beastie.

Your creativity and thoughtfulness are truly heartwarming. Having someone play the trumpet, one of my favorite instruments, for my birthday was beyond amazing. I don't care about the little tweaks or adjustments you made; it was perfect. Bringing me that cake, baking it with so much love, and showing up with your bubbly self to shower me with affection made my birthday unforgettable. Turning 50 last year felt so different without someone to share it with, but this year, you made it a dream come true.

The gorgeous chocolate mud cake you made is now waiting for us at Marilyn’s. Let's plan for us to pick Levi and I up at 2:30 p.m? so we can head to Simmy's place on Barbra Road without any stress and then go to Marilyn’s for afternoon tea. Lara and her daughter Bella will join us at 4pm, and I'm excited for you to meet them. 

Thank you for making my birthday so special. I can't wait to see you later.

Love,
Besty

Sorry I missed this last night - it was lost amongst the other texts I sent you and attending to Levi's needs. Thanks for letting me know. I completely understand how burnt out you must feel - you have a busy life with a full work schedule, kids, needy dog, and a loving partner. 
Acknowledging your limitations and seeking balance for self-care is a wise decision.

Also, weeknight outings during winter can be tough. I strategically planned this get-together across the road so dinner would be as effortless as possible.

Ill definitely let 'my Michelle' know, lol, that you really enjoyed meeting her and that you're looking forward to catching up with her another time soon. I'm just pleased that you have finally met her.

Take care and rest up.  And If your tendency  to wave-ish ness  or something traumatic happens again,  a hug or phone call is literally minutes away. It is these little things that keep us connected... and add to our growing love story.

I hope the rest of your day went smoothly with your clients. 

Levi and I are home now, just enjoying some downtime together. We're planning to head out for dinner soon - his favorite spot, Etto, for their half-price pasta night.

I wanted to touch base about our schedules for tomorrow. Levi has a school assembly performance from 9 to 10 in the morning, and I'll be there cheering him on. I’ll need to leave Melbourne around 12:30 or 1:00 to head out to Geelong, and pick Pepper up.

If you have a little window of free time tomorrow, I'd love to drop by and see you- and  be wonderful to give Gibson a big pat too.

Let me know what works for you. xxx",,

Hope your day is starting off well.

I just got a text from Dassi, she’s woken up with a sore throat and says she isn’t feeling well - but perhaps also sad she isn’t going to be with her daughter today on her birthday. So, I’ll need to handle the school pick-up today. It might be a bit tight, similar to last Monday, but I’ll talk to Marilyn and see if I can drop him off at her place after school. As I’d still love to see you afterward. It’s going to be a beautiful afternoon, and it would be wonderful to connect, if you would like?

Hope your day going well. 
My day a tad stressful as my laptop charger not working so I need to go to office works after work . 
My car too decided to have a few probs this morning- the windows and doors and mirrors not working . 
Would so love to see you and also I really need to get this charger which I hope is in stock in Elsternwick so it’s quick to fix. 
Let me know where you are at later… or if it turns out we connect on Tuesday weather is warm then too. 
Love you 😘",,

I’m sorry to hear about your stressful day-sounds like your car and laptop decided to act up at the same time! I hope the charger is in stock at Officeworks, and you can get everything sorted quickly.

I just got word that Jan is free to look after Levi today, so that frees me up. Let me know how your day is going, and we can still meet up if that works for you. I’m looking forward to seeing you, whenever it works out.

Love you too 😘",,

Also wanted to say I realise in retrospect I was acting like a psychologist instead of a friend when you expressed your disappointment in Marcel  ie I was trying to get you to see other perspectives which wasn’t very supportive. 

Anyway I just want you to know I can see why you feel let down. And that I will do my best as your true bestie never to let you down so you can put all that behind you.  I have such a deep desire to support you because I love you so much  and you are my best friend too. As my kids get older I want nothing more than to be there more and more for you. 

And finally I wanted to let you know I have come up with a great date idea for us on 31 August . It’s a home date at my place ( lol no fanciful ideas  venturing out of our comfort zones that fall flat on their face …!) and I’m really excited to surprise you .

Love you bestie❤️😘❤️😘❤️",,
Melanie,2024-08-13 18:40:13,2024-08-13 18:40:14,,,iMessage,Outgoing,,,Delivered,,,"Hey Bestie,

Oh no, no, you were a very supportive friend. I actually love the way you help me see things from different angles. Marcel’s always been like this, so it’s not really a surprise. It just made me realise that I was being a bit irritable about it, frustrated, and maybe even a little angry. And then I started questioning why I was feeling that way. But no, it’s fine. It does come down to wanting to be supported and cared for, and I know you would be even more if you could.

I've coped on my own for a few years before I met you, so I do have mechanisms to handle things. When I see those warning signs like getting irritable, angry, or feeling overwhelmed, I usually pivot and think of ways to look after myself. Right now, I’m actively thinking about what I can do on Friday night and Saturday morning to carve out some time for myself. But, you know, it’s always a balance between wanting time alone and then feeling lonely. So it’s just something I’m working through at the moment. But don’t worry, I’ll be good.

I never feel let down by you. You’re absolutely gorgeous, and I’m so glad you chose a home date. I was really hoping you would. We’ve had a lot going on lately, and with so many plans ahead—concerts, the trip to Sydney—I really appreciate that we’re at this point in our relationship where we’re beyond just dating and can also take pleasure in our comfort zones. There’s nothing more comforting than being in your little love nest, and I’ve loved every single experience we’ve had there together. And I believe I’ve  journaled every one of them…

Can’t wait for my surprise. Thank you for coming up with such a great date idea.

Love you ❤️😘🎺😘❤️🎺",,

At one month I already missed you when you went to Sydney so much so that I drove to the airport just so I could see your sweet sweet face. At 2 months I missed you so much at Christmas time that my sadness was so deeply overwhelming and my longing led to you once more at an airport - this time Sydney. 
At 3, 4 and 5 months I started to miss you as soon as we said goodbye to each other. And then as the months went on going to bed without you raised a deep longing in me to lie naked with you no less than every night… hungry for your skin on mine. The comfort that brings me is indescribable. 
And now, the night before our 10 month anniversary I lie here yearning to hug you and to be hugged by you. My eyes fill with tears at the thought of just how deeply attached we have become. It’s so wonderful and yet  a thought away is “ please don’t let me ever lose you now” 
I love you, I love you , I love you! 
Happy 10 months to the most beautiful man I have ever met. 
You are my everything and now I miss you in every moment that we are not together.  I can’t wait to see you today beastie.
All my love, care, attention and devotion forever and ever , Melanie ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️🥳",,

Your heartfelt message speaks to the profound truth that the deepest love comes hand in hand with the deepest longing. Our blessed connection, is so beautifully entwined with every fiber of who we are, and is both a source of immense joy and, at times, an aching reminder of how much we mean to one another. The depth of this very special bond is measured not only by the time we spend together but by the space also created to miss each other, to yearn, and to cherish what we have. This can come with an intensity that few ever get to experience. To love each other so completely is to embrace the entire spectrum of human emotions - from the heights of our ecstasy to the depths of our longing. But it’s that very depth, that ability to feel so profoundly, that makes our love both resilient and deeply meaningful. After all the pain and suffering we’ve both endured, it sure is a beautiful awakening to feel fully alive once more.
Our love is a testament to the beauty of life and the inevitability of loss – but it's a love that I will protect and cherish with everything I am. You are my everything, and together we will continue to navigate our journey, embracing both the joy and the sorrow, the presence and the absence, with all the strength and tenderness our hearts can hold. I don’t worry we both have BIG hearts! ♥️ ❤️

Can’t wait to see you today beautiful girl!  I am all yours when your are ready to see me. 

Love Nathan  🥳🍾🥰❤️❤️😘👧🏻",,

From the moment you picked me up at work, it felt like such a special treat. You looked incredibly sexy and adorable. My kind of girl is one who accessorises with librarian glasses and a matching  psychology textbook. So hot! 🔥🔥🔥. I loved your outfit so much, and it was such a fun surprise to realise we were matching in our denim and green tops - in sync again!

As I returned from getting lunch thanks for letting me drift past your car just so you could check me out haha. But I found you, and I am so glad I did, so we could later bond over raw fish and other things I thoughtfully itemised for you in our lunch box. 

Thanks for that lovely walk to sit on a beach bench overlooking the stillness of the bay -everything felt just right. Our deep conversations, sharing our thoughts on life, love, and each other, followed by those passionate kisses… it was all so perfect, and it’s all still as fresh in my mind as that delicious sashimi we ate. 

Even after 10 months, the excitement and connection between us on dates haven’t faded one bit—I can see us being just like this in another 10 months, and then another, and another. 

I’m already yearning for the next time we can be together, for our laid-back weekend plans - especially the cozy sleepover in your lovely little nest. I can’t wait to be wrapped up in your arms again.

Love your Bestest Beastie Bestie.

As much as you find the librarian glasses and psychology textbook hot 🔥… what I find incredibly attractive about you ( one of many things)  is this knack you have to summarise and encapsulate our dates with such finesse and insight into a single text message. I have loved your “dot points” and summaries from day 1 and I will love them always.  Don’t stop it’s such a turn on for me … it’s those words again my fellow sapiosexual ! They are incredibly powerful and I am so grateful to be reminded of those small moments which mean so much. It wasn’t just a drive and a walk .. it was a few hours filled with our quirky behaviours , mind blowing sync- ing and perfect conversations … and I love your running commentary, like when you itemised the vegetables in our lunch box the sweetness of your nature shining through  just made me smile and feel so happy - you are so gorgeously cute ( and sexy)! 

Have a great day sweetest one and drive safely to Warrandyte. It’s true, 10 Months in,  and still filled with excitement at the thought of seeing you again on the weekend.

Hi Nathan, hope you all had a good week. So sorry to do this, but can we reschedule tomorrow  night? Riley fell off the monkey bars at school and has injured his neck and we are giving him time to rest and take it easy. Fortunately, he will be OK, he just needs to lay low. 

Please let me know when you’re next available and we will book in another date. Xx

I had a few lovely walks- one with Sandra who suggested we get together with you me and Levi and her and Andrew and her grandson Osi. We can chat about an afternoon when this might work.

Still feeling the warm glow of our time together yesterday. I also really appreciated the growing comfort I feel when I’m with both you and Levi. … and your eggplant dish was amazingly delicious!

Love you and miss you best beautiful man. I’ll be leaving the city at 3 or just past 3 tomorrow- I can’t remember if it’s a Dasi Monday or not .. anyway if you are around my passenger seat will be calling your name. 

Lots of love,
Bestie 😘 ❤️💕

Ps it’s Father’s Day next Sunday and I was wondering if it’s ok if I organise something very small with Levi , to give to you ?  If that’s ok I’ll send him a voice recording to check something with him in a moment.",,

Thanks for your sweet message. 

Up bright and early, we headed into the city for indoor rock climbing near the Queen Vic market. No traffic!  I got to be Levis trusty belay, watching him fearless scale the walls. Afterward, we treated ourselves to some bratwurst at the Queen Vic market and I grabbed some more organic decaf coffee beans to keep my supply going.

The afternoon was about relaxation. We also swung by Marilyn's to pick up a few things we left behind and enjoyed some tea before heading home. For dinner, I heated my eggplant parmigiana and fried up some marinated mini chicken drumsticks for Levi - it was again delicious! And how good was the rain as that storm rolled in. ⛈️ 🥰

I crashed at 8 last night and didn’t wake up until  6am. Hoping on doing it all over again tonight. I’ve been sleeping with the door open and the fresh air did wonders.

So glad you enjoyed our two little dates yesterday - both were equally as enjoyable and delicious! (omg we ate so well yesterday 👌) The world seemed to melt away when we were together in that quaint little restaurant. At times, I forgot we were even in Melbourne. Despite my initial (desperate lol) efforts to get the waiters to find us a spot where we could sit side by side, it didn’t turn out so bad after all. In fact, I loved being able to look at your beautiful face and hold your hand between our effortless conversations. Effortless, just like the time we spend together with Levi. It means the world to me to see how naturally we’ve all come together, and I’m so grateful for it.

I didn’t realise Father’s Day is just around the corner. No plans yet, but if you have something small and sweet up your sleeve, I’m all in. Thank you! I would love to catch up with Sandra, Andrew, and little Osi with Levi. Im always up for connecting with other people.

Love you and miss you too, my beautiful Bestie. I’ll definitely be around tomorrow, so if your passenger seat is still calling my name, you know I’ll be there in a heartbeat.

Big hugs and lots of love, Beasty 😘❤️💕",,

Melanie,2024-09-01 08:51:34,2024-09-01 08:51:36,,,iMessage,Outgoing,,,Delivered,,,"What Happens When You Take a Shower After Eating?

When you take a warm bath or shower, your body undergoes a process known as hyperthermic action. This procedure raises your internal body temperature by one or two degrees. 

In general, hyperthermic action is beneficial to your health. It can:

Boost your immune system
Calm down your nervous system
Activate your sweat glands to eliminate toxins
Your body temperature drops after a shower, according to medical science. The body has to work harder to maintain the normal temperature to support digestion because it starts to cool down. The blood that aids in digestion begins to flow to other body parts. As a result, it slows down the process of the digestive system. Further, it may cause discomfort, unease, and acidity. ",,

That’s soooo sweet the message Levi wrote … thanks for sharing! . I hope he showered you with love today 💕

I felt so content after leaving you today .  When walking up to Abi s place  in the sun ( and wind)I  had a noticeable spring in my step. Laughing and giggling with you is THE BEST  - I can think of nothing more joyful and we did a lot of that this weekend. Those belly laughs with you make life truly amazing! 

Sandra has asked the 3 of us over on weekend of 14/15 September- I said I would check with you but I thought Sunday avo might be a good time for a quick pop in? Her place has some toys there for her grandson so there will be things to keep Levi occupied and we can keep it short and sweet .

Missing you already Beastie 😈.. cooked  a giant   🍆 in your honour tonight!

Hey Bestie,

Had a really nice day hanging out with Levi today. He’s still battling that nasty cough, so we just took it easy - watched a movie, grabbed some tacos, walked Muffin, and I treated him to an organic lemonade, which he loved. Spent the afternoon just relaxing, caught a nap, and messed around on my computer a bit.

Last night was amazing. It was so lovely of you to host me with that bath and the delicious food. I’m so lucky to have you in my life! The laughs 🤣, the connection, the banter and in sync analytics —it all means so much to me. 

I have pencilled in Sunday 15th for a catchup with Sandra an co.

Also pencil in these dates for us:

Saturday 7th “Touch” screening at Bay Street Palace 7pm session
Saturday 14th “The Whale” screening in Melanies bedroom after another relaxing bath and dinner.
Saturday 21st “Netflix and chill”   at Nathan’s 6:00pm  ( “When he invites you to his house and you realise he has no tv.” lol. And with a side of eggplant parmigiana if hunger strikes ,  🍆 🍆 🍆 😈) Closer to the date please advise your man your deepest desires for the evening. 😉

Good night my sweet. Love you and miss you heaps.

Marilyn was a lifesaver, dropping by at lunchtime with some food, which was such a comfort. I’ve been on my laptop most of the day, juggling work and looking after Levi. Tomorrow, he’ll be at Marilyn’s again since it’s just a half day at school with student-teacher interviews in the afternoon. I’ve also got an orthodontist appointment, so it’s shaping up to be another busy day.

Work’s thrown some juicy work my way, and while it’s keeping me on my toes, I’m handling it. Hope your day was okay?

Your sweet love is my anchor, and I’m counting down the moments until we’re together again. 

Love you ❤️❤️ 😘😘",,

I’m so proud of you! Getting that kind of recognition as a vendor or subcontractor is really special - in my world those shoutouts are usually reserved for the permies only. It’s amazing how you’ve carved out this great niche  job for yourself, and even better that they genuinely value what you bring to the table. My juggle is going okay. I had an orthodontist appointment at lunch -finally at the end of my treatment. The buzzy machine wasn’t fun, but my teeth are looking good. I also had a parent-teacher meeting about Levi, and wow, that kid is something else! He’s about a year or more ahead in maths and reading, and on top of that, he’s so well-loved and popular at school. I’m really proud of him. He is at Marilyn’s this afternoon, so I now have some quiet time to myself. Sort of lol,  my delivery manager is keeping me on my toes with some fires to put out, but it’s good to feel like I’m really contributing at work again. I love you lots and can’t wait to hear more about you…❤️ xxx",,

Your gorgeous boy is so intelligent and emotionally intelligent too - a wonderful little human being. And all that he is comes from your parenting bestie- even if kids have potential they don’t flourish like Levi is flourishing without safety, love and warm supportive parenting . All of this you give Levi every day. You should be incredibly proud of how you show up for Levi. 
I can’t wait to watch him continue to grow - he will turn out spectacular ! … ( he already is!) he is going to be your joy, your precious jewel in your life and he is so lucky to have you  and you, him!

We are in sync again as I was just about to send you this podcast. After we mentioned Buddhism yesterday I re discovered Robina Courtin. In fact this podcast answered the question you posed yesterday on ‘ what would the buddhists say about wanting to see your boyfriend more often?’!
My understanding is that it’s ok to enjoy the boy, the piece of cake, the new house etc  but at the end of the day a big part of feeling all the positive emotions is from inside your own mind.  Which we both already know and practice .  So if I were more practiced at understanding my mind I would be able to go a week without seeing you and my body would remain at peace with that … don’t they call it equanimity? Anyway it’s ok that I like seeing my beastie and I continue to work on my mind.

I just wanted to thank you for a beautiful weekend. From your thoughtful flowers to the deep comfort I felt when lying next to you watching the movie - I felt like I was with a best friend that I had known for many years and that I was finally home after searching for so long. Those brief moments of complete peace and satisfaction I have with you I have not felt in years if ever at all. 
The feeling of deep connection continued over breakfast as the room around me faded and all I could feel was you and I. You, me and the blossoms…. Perfect. 
And still I felt our growth like the blossoming trees of Mckinnon Road, as I lay on your couch.. the beauty of us blossoming through the seasons to become more steady than the spring flowers, our roots entwined together … a place of sustenance and safety. 
Thank you Beastie for being in my life. I adore you ❤️😘❤️😘",,

Awww, your words are so good  Bestie , they have left me feeling so grateful to have someone who can express their feelings about us with such depth and sincerity. Yes! We’ve grown roots together, weathering all the seasons, and now we’ve arrived at a place of peace and divine comfort around each other. I adore you too and big pats on our backs for all the effort we have put into the making of  “us”.  We both deserve all this - and more! … to come… 😘❤️😘❤️

Hey my love, I’ve been reflecting on yesterday and today, and I want you to know how grateful I am for you. Despite the ugly moments and the painful emotions that came up, I’m truly in awe of how you were able to stay calm and soothe me, by just holding me for a prolonged period, when I needed it most -despite being the target of my frightening anger, this shows the strength of your love for us. Im sorry, I’ll continue to be mindful of where my anger can go,  thank you. I experienced a mix of deep frustration, anger, and hurt, but also a sense of connection, empathy, and growth. It means the world to me that we could face such a difficult situation and still find our way back to each other with love and understanding - and incredible physical intimacy/closeness that has exceeded anything in my past. I know I didn’t handle everything perfectly, but you showed me so much grace, and I feel incredibly lucky to have you by my side. I can see now we needed some conflict, it has brought some things to the surface and brought us even closer, because I really am committed to growing with you. I love you, and I’m looking forward to our journey together, every step of the way.

Your text certainly did stop me in my tracks around the lake. I’m stopping on a windy but warm bench to reciprocate my deep levels of gratitude for you. ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
The hurt we felt was so very worth the closeness I felt with you in the aftermath.  Today I know you a little deeper than I have. And that growth makes me feel so happy. 
Just when I think I can’t adore you any more we never fail to level up together to the next stage of us. 
I’m sorry too that I hurt you and thank you for taking responsibility for your part - that’s all I ‘ll ever need to be able to forgive.  
I love all of you Nathan.
I’m with you bestie. 
You are the love of my life and I love how you have taught me about myself through our relationship. 
We have now seen the uglier parts of each other ( and of your bathroom lol) yet I still find you  more beautiful than ever!

desire towards holding you when you are overwhelmed— it’s automatic - even in the face of anger I just wanted to care for you.

I’ve canceled my gym session for tomorrow morning, but that’s all good—I’ll use the extra time to relax, finish up the packing, and tidy up the house before you pick us up at 8:30.

Thank you so much for dinner tonight; it was absolutely delicious. I really wished I could’ve stayed longer because being around you just feels so right, and I never want our time together to end. And it's clear I'm not the only one who feels that way. 🧒🏼 

Alright, Bestie, have a beautiful sleep tonight. I’m so excited—we did it! Just one more sleep until our holiday! 😘👧🏻🛫

Woke up late with Citrix cuddling me 
It’s Elijah’s birthday 
So lots of remembering going on 

Think I’ll just get Cody and watch netflex and get groceries deliver by MILKRUN 

 A Amazon delivery arrived 
I get my coconut milk delivered 
It’s cheaper 

It’s was so lovely to met Melanie 
She’s so lovely 
And I felt we connected well
I’m very happy for you 

I’m missing Levi 
We get on so well 
And he laughs at me 
I miss looking outside and watching him play backyard tennis 
He would get up early and play 

He will be at poppys 
So you will have time to yourself

I’m so glad you’ve chosen a snuggle up tonight. That is exactly what I feel like after a very action packed week since we went away. I actually had a thought for this too, except with this movie, which I mentioned  not so long ago - one of my favourite French films of all time and a classic. I’ll have a look at the Netflix trailer and we can make a decision later. So yes please! if you’re up for sun fresh sheets, a light fruit and cheese platter and a low-key evening with loving arms wrapped around you then please come around any time after 5pm..

I’m feeling a bit better, but I think I just need plenty of rest after such a busy time. Last week was crazy, and I’m taking a break from coding for now. I went for a massage after we spoke, which helped. I’ve also been making some healthy food - smoothies.

It’s a bit of a shame I don’t have much energy tonight. I would’ve loved to head down to the beach with Levi, but resting is the best option. Tomorrow’s looking beautiful, so I’m looking forward to that too. I’ll confirm in the morning if I’ll be heading into the city. I hope so - M is picking L up from school. Can’t wait to see you!

P.S. Between your trumpet and our “practice sessions,” the neighbours are probably wondering when our album is dropping! 😜🎺
P.P.S. I just wanted your parents to know how lucky I am to have you in my life. They should be so proud of you. 🌟

'In a stunning sequel to their critically acclaimed debut, Mystery Date, Melanie and Nathan return to the silver screen in Mystery Date II: The Reunion. Set against the same intimate jazz venue as the original, this time the characters have evolved, showcasing an even deeper connection. The once-nervous energy of new romance is now replaced with the quiet, comfortable warmth of two souls entirely at ease with each other.

Nathan brings a relaxed charm to the role - more content in Melanie’s presence than ever before. Whether it’s hugging, stroking, or tender kisses, the chemistry between the two leads is undeniable. And Melanie? She’s a revelation, moving beyond the shy intrigue of the first installment. This time, she faces Nathan fully, offering more eye contact. Nathan can no longer only admire just the back of her neck - now it’s her captivating eyes, her warm smile, and the easy grace with which she navigates the world around her.

The backdrop, once again, is the Jazz Lab, but this time, the soundtrack is provided by a professional band that elevates the experience to new heights. The audience, utterly transfixed by the music, serves as a perfect foil to Nathan and Melanie’s increasingly passionate moments, unnoticed by all but the stars of their own love story. Their connection, in many ways, steals the show -because what could be more engaging than two people who’ve found their rhythm, both in the music and in each other?”

Final Verdict: Mystery Date II is the perfect follow-up, blending nostalgia with the joy of deepening affection. The love story continues to hit all the right notes, and fans of the first installment will not be disappointed. ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️",,
Melanie,2024-10-13 20:52:49,,2024-10-13 20:52:55,,iMessage,Incoming,+61412667520,Melanie,Read,,,"Goodnight Bestie - I love that you wrote this! Such a beautiful reminder of our early dating and our word exchanges. 

Mystery Date II was indeed a stunning cinematic experience that surpassed the original movie on all levels. Although Mystery Date I came with all the suspense and sexual tension that only new love can muster, this sequel provided viewers with a rare glimpse into the warm connection that only soulmate lovers exude.  Viewers are left with the confusing mystery of whether the director intended the spotlight to be on the talented jazz band or the delightful couple- both captivating to the brim. 

Nathan’s performance,  in particular, was reminiscent of his Oscar winning presence in the original movie ; sweet, heartwarmingly eccentric and the perfect loving gentleman. Only this time he is more confident and exudes a “ beastieness” that only elevates the viewers watching experience. Melanie spends most of the movie so relaxed in her now familiar lover’s arms and present enough to enjoy the well performed soundtrack that viewers are left wondering if her transformation is slightly  unrealistic. 
More than anything, this movie confirms that despite the adversity and losses that each character has endured, true lovers will eventually find each other and that true love is real and will always prevail.

This weekend was pure joy with you,
The playful, steamy sauna’s view.
A handmade card, words carefully chosen,
Moments shared, hearts softly open.

Cooking you dinner, made with care,
Driving far, sweet memories there.
Our first mystery date, now revived,
Returning home, love truly thrives.

You fed me supper, simple and sweet,
Yet what followed, a deeper feat.
Despite my tiredness, right on cue,
Our connection ignited, a love so true.

Half asleep at 3am, we banter with ease,
Teasing ’bout me aiming as I please.
Husband and wifey, in our playful lore,
Have we done this all before?

Waking up to reconnect and more,
In morning light, we love once more.
Another brunch, an adventure anew,
And endless loop, just me and you.

Have a great day beautiful. Thinking about you lots this week as we celebrate our very special love - and finding each other! ❤️",,

I was wondering if I could take you on a romantic date to see living legend Herbie Hancock at the lawn of the Sydney Myer bowl on Saturday night. We could head in and set up a picnic rug. Opens at 4pm and doesn’t finish too late?  It is the opening night of the Melbourne Jazz festival. 🥰❤️🎺 l 🎹 😘👧🏻,,

I’m so relieved I finally committed to something - after all the obsessed research over the past week. I will be so glad to have some certainty around the cost of keeping a car on the road again.I found one I’m really happy with and I’ll be taking delivery of it at the end of the month. I’d love it if you’d come with me to pick it up and share that excitement with me. It would mean so much to have you there - if you are free on that day.

I just had an interview for the remote job with an overseas company, and it went really well—they’ve passed me on to the second stage. I’ve been so busy this week, and even though it hasn’t felt like much of a holiday, I feel like I’ve used my time really productively, even with all the Jewish holidays and Levi being around.

I’ve been thinking about you soooo much , and I’m so looking forward to unwinding with you tonight, sharing all this good news, catching up, and hearing about your week too. I hope your day’s going well, and I can’t wait to see you soon, my most special ove.  🚗❤️😍",,

Melanie,2024-10-21 18:04:58,,,,iMessage,Outgoing,,,Delivered,,,"Hey Bestie 💕Just wanted to let you know how my day went. The commute into work was a bit of a pain—stuck in traffic the whole way, so it wasn’t the best start. But once I arrived, everything picked up. Everyone there is really friendly, and my manager seems like a genuinely nice guy. The energy is so much more laid-back, not as micromanage-y as my last role, which feels like a breath of fresh air. And the building itself is really nice—feels like a great place to be.

I got my work laptop today and got it all set up, so I’m ready to go. The onboarding was actually pretty smooth, and I feel good about it. The only thing is, my team’s in the office on Thursdays and Fridays, so I’ll be working from home on Mondays, Tuesdays, and Wednesdays.Bus-babe rides home with you on Thursdays if you’re around? —it would be lovely to continue those moments together. Sadly, it looks like I won’t be able to work from your place on Fridays for a while, which I’m bummed about. But we’ll figure something else out, I’m sure. 

Overall, I’m really looking forward to this new role. And I followed up on that other job—the recruiter thinks the American company will reach out for a second interview this week, so fingers crossed.

It’s been a long day, and we have  scouts tonight, but I’m feeling a lot less anxious and more settled, like I’m finding my rhythm again, which feels right. Anyway, I hope you had a beautiful day. If you want to call between 7 and 8, I’d absolutely love to hear your voice. If not, would love to see you tomorrow.

That’s a bummer we miss out on Fridays - you are welcome to work at my place on Tuesdays for a change of scenery if you like - even if I’m in and out of the house we can just pretend we live together for a while.

Also thanks for asking me along to your car pick up - I’m usually not really done by at least 3.15 so was thinking so I don’t hold you up or be rushing  I could get the train to Richmond and you could pick me up with your new set of wheels on your way back  - that way we can enjoy your excitement together for a bit … what do you think? 
Love Bestie xxx",,

Thanks for being so thoughtful and letting me know. I totally get it - if you’ve got a busy few days, it’s important to rest and make sure Z gets his homework done. Let’s put the movie on hold for now, and if a small window opens up on Thursday, we can just catch up briefly instead. No pressure, whatever works best for you.

And that sounds like a great plan for the car pick-up! I’d love to swing by Richmond and pick you up with the new wheels. That way, we can still have that moment together without you feeling rushed. I appreciate you making it work for us.

Love you heaps, Beastie xxx",,

Here is a longer text to make up for my monosyllabic ones earlier. 
I hope the rest of yr day went well.
I have harnessed my sadness in order to reflect and introspect.
I just adore the beautiful trustworthy sexy sweet passionate man that you are. Nothing ever changes my love for you - it is steadfast and sure. I really don’t want to lose you…. You are everything to me. 
This is why I will do everything I possibly can to work on myself. 
I have contacted another therapist as I want more help than just the emdr but will do both. 
I also know that last time I just decided to be ok with your friendships and it worked at the time.  I have always been in that place of accepting and would never want those friendships to change - they  are a  very special part of your life that matter a lot. … I want you to enjoy them and openly share with me and I will try to show more interest and ask more questions. You are right in the scheme of things it’s not a big deal.   I really think we can get past this. If it’s a choice between hurting our relationship or just putting on my big girl pants ( and spending lots of money on therapy lol) I need to choose the latter . Please be patient with me while I work on this? 
I miss you so so so much and I can’t wait to see you again  and chat with you soon and give you a big squeezey  hug. 
Thanks for sucking on my bottom lip today and making be laugh in the brief moment we had together in the sunshine.
Love Bestie xx",,
Melanie,2024-10-29 20:01:00,,,,iMessage,Outgoing,,,Delivered,,,"Oh, beautiful, you’re not going to lose me. You’re everything to me as well. I understand you’re feeling sad today, and I think it’s good to sometimes sit with that feeling. Monday night was rough, and I hate when the frustrated side of me comes out, especially when I’m tired and irritable—it’s not who I want to be. But I did really hear you, and I got where your pain was coming from before my own frustrations seeped through.

I know we can get past this; it’s just one small part of our relationship and nowhere close to overshadowing the beauty we have together. You’ve handled more than most people could, and I’ve seen you put on those “big girl pants” many times. There’s absolutely no rush for you to heal from your trauma. I’ll be here, fully understanding the gravity of it, and I want you to know that I’m committed to being the right man to support you through it. I’ll keep showing up, no matter what.

It’s tough to start the week with conflict, especially when we can’t connect as easily. But, as always, we’ll come back together as if no time has passed. And thank you for sharing some of your generous saliva with my poor, dexy tortured dry mouth—can’t wait to return some to you the next time our lips reunite lol. I miss you so much!

Sweet dreams sweet girl.  xx",,

I hope your day is going well . 
Wanted to share this with you… 
It was so weird I woke up this morning feeling as though the sadness veil had been lifted totally. 
Lo and behold my period arrived today . 
Those tears and despair are soooooo much to do with hormones. Almost all of it. 
Anyway good news is I’m back to myself again . 
Maybe I should just become a drug addict once a month to get through those few yuck days. 
Love you lots, Bestie XX 😘",,

Hey Bestie! I just found out something awesome I think you’ll love—Central Otago, near Queenstown, is a major Pinot Noir region! Some of the finest Pinot Noirs in the world come from there, and it’s supposed to be absolutely stunning. I’m thinking we definitely need to plan a wine tasting stop or even grab a glass during one of our dinners when we’re in Queenstown. I’m already excited thinking about it! Can’t wait to explore this (and share a glass with you).

Lara invited me to dinner tonight to celebrate her 50th, so I'll be out this evening. Honestly, I’m feeling pretty anxious about it. It’s been a tough week after dealing with the emotional toll of my car getting damaged (its not the car, its the reawakening of my dormant loss/ grief and it has been traumatic), and I’m not really in the mood to go out. I know we’ve talked about your feelings when it comes to me spending time with female friends, and I want to be sensitive to that, but I’m also struggling with my own discomfort. Before I met you, I would have just gone out and enjoyed myself with her, but it feels different now. It doesn’t really matter how much we go over this - it is an issue at the moment. It’s a bit disheartening because I’ve put so much effort into maintaining these friendships, and I want them to still feel meaningful.

Just wanted to share where I’m at, and I appreciate you understanding. 💙",,

I could feel your overwhelm through your texts and also our interactions and have been thinking about you a lot … and trying to reflect and work out why you seem a little withdrawn. Thank you for sharing with me your feelings of grief that have come up. It really helps to know - I was struggling a bit with the feeling of your withdrawal but was being patient  knowing you often need to reflect for a bit, so it helps to know what’s going on for you. 
I really appreciate your text and attempt to make me feel safe in our relationship. I really hope you don’t resent me in any way for how things have changed. I guess when one is in a relationship, space or changes do  need to be made for the other person to feel safe … I’m not sure there is any way around this at all.  
Please have a lovely dinner with Lara.  I too want your friendship with Lara to continue to be meaningful and a way to keep Romy  s memory alive. 
I love you a lot and wish I could give you a big hug.

I’ve had a really busy day. I got up early and headed down to the Elwood Farmer’s Market to pick up some essentials like local olive oil and basil. I even found a purple cauliflower for Zach—I’ll bring that around tonight. I also picked up some John Dory fillets, so we can fry them up together. I’ve got avocado, dill, and iceberg lettuce leftover from yesterday, so I’m happy to whip up an extra little salad to bring along too?

Levi and I had a great morning when I got back. We went out to Carlisle Street Bulk Foods to get ingredients for our Christmas cake. We’ve measured everything out, and we’re baking it tomorrow. We even stopped by Marilyn’s house to grab the brandy for it. Once it’s baked, it’ll only get better and better over the next four weeks until Christmas Day.

Later, I spent a couple of hours repairing my $600 noise-cancelling headphones. The plastic headband broke, but I found a replacement part on Alibaba Express and followed a YouTube video to fix it. It was pretty fiddly, but I managed to do it and saved myself from buying a new pair. It feels good to repair things instead of just tossing them out and adding to landfill.

We just had a barbecue and have been relaxing this afternoon. I’m dropping Levi off at four, and then I can come around whenever you’re ready. Looking forward to your magic aircon—and especially you. I miss you so much and can’t wait for tonight. It’s supposed to cool down later, so if we feel like going for a drive, that could be fun too. xxx",,

My heart skipped a beat when I read that you got Zach a purple cauliflower  .. your kind thoughtfulness makes me feel teary. I also love how weird we all are … hehe a purple cauliflower for my 17 year old son lol🤪😂🤗🥰
It’s so beautiful to have a bestie to send my pie photo too and a bestie who cares and gets exactly how making that pie was so relaxing for me.
I’m glad your  market excursion, Levi bonding time and handy skills gave you pleasure today.   It must nearly be Christmas if you are making Christmas cake! I’m sure it will be spectacular 😃👨🏻‍🦲
I’m really excited to see you bestie !!  My chest is swirling 🥰.. will let you know what time z is leaving as soon as I know   Xx

Hi Bestie, so thrilled to hear that Gibson’s eating again—sounds like you’ve got your pawsome pal back! 🐾🦮💕

It’s been a pretty busy day at home for me, just getting on top of things and delivering some more work. Nothing on the job front today, but fingers crossed 🤞 for another bite tomorrow. 

Levi and I just got back from Yochi on Church Street 🍦, My gym got flooded, but they managed to clean up the mess for me to have a session tomorrow morning, which I’m pumped for. 💪 But what I’m really looking forward to is getting a lift home with you tomorrow. 🚗💞 I can’t wait to see you, wrap you in a big bear hug, and fur real let you know how much I miss you. 

Love you so much, Beastie! 🥰❤️",,

Yes, according to Miranda July and her very successful novel released this year. Given your recent experiences, it seemed like a perfect fit for you. Perhaps some summer reading?

I’m going to climb into bed and will be asleep I’m sure before 9. I really need to be on holiday soon. 
I hope you had a good day sweet man?

I’m so glad you had a busy client day—it must feel rewarding but exhausting. You definitely deserve an early night, and I’m right there with you. I’m so tired, running on adrenaline, and will probably be asleep before 9 too. It’s been a whirlwind—I’ve been networking every day, and today I finally finished the program I wrote to send my resume to all the recruiters I’ve worked with over the last 8 years. It’s already brought in some exciting leads, including ANZ Bank and Sportsbet, which kept me on the phone all afternoon! 😂 

I’ll be wrapping up the job search by the end of the week and can’t wait to shift gears and start focusing on our holiday. I’m so looking forward to being with you for such a beautiful stretch of time, away from all the busyness.

I’d love a lift home tomorrow if it works for you, but no pressure—I want you to rest too. Sending you so much love and a big squeezey hug back. Sleep well, my love. Sweet dreams 🥰 Your sweet man xx 😘",,

Levi is feeling better tonight and he did make up with his friend. We had Shabbat dinner at Marilyns tonight and Adam was there too. But now it is all about party night and he is well into gear enjoying himself now.

I’ve felt your good loving vibes since this morning’s kiss in the lift, and it’s stayed with me all day! Having you in my life makes everything better. Sleep well, my love -I can’t wait to see you tomorrow.

Imagine being still madly in love after 57 yers of marriage and you were reunited with that!

I want to thank you for the effort you put into digitising your wedding video. Sharing something so deeply meaningful from 22 years ago, and allowing me to glimpse that part of your life, was such a beautiful act of vulnerability. Seeing such an important chapter of your life made me feel even closer to you.

Watching it was an absolute joy -I would have fallen head over heels for you back then too! But I’m so grateful that the universe brought us together when it did, allowing us to nurture our special love  (that could easily exist in any time or space) with the wisdom and care we’ve gained over time.

Ps I kissed you on the cheek twice in from of Marilyn today. Cheeky man. xx😁",,

Thank YOU beastie for coming up with the idea and then watching the young fragile translucent version of me sign away my first legal document … the first of a few that would follow 21 years later!  It was so much fun when you called out “ don’t sign young Melanie!”  Your sense of humour…. It’s so sweet ! 

We are so lucky that young Melanie and young Nathan got to mature ourselves first before falling deeply into each other. There is no other person I’d rather share that video and my life with than you. 

Ps cheeky man .. I loved when you kissed me twice at Marilyn’s.

He’d let his hand drift gently upward, lightly tracing along your spine until it reached the delicate curve of your neck. With the softest touch, he’d massage away the tension, easing you into a peaceful relaxation. Holding you tightly, he’d whisper in your ear, “Good night, my love,” so tenderly that it would linger in your dreams. 😘👧🏻😴💭😈",,

22/12
5/1
12/1 ? 

Also maybe we could do a New Year’s Day avo tea at my place with your mum and Marilyn and Henri and Adam? And anyone else you think… ? 

Looking forward to popping in tonight - what time did you say?

I just want to start by saying how proud I am of you for being direct with me over the weekend. I know it’s something you’re keen to work on in terms of improving how we navigate my female friendships,  it means so much to me now I have had some time to reflect on the moment. Strong move, well done. 

I think it’s a great idea hosting Deb and her family on Sunday afternoon at your place. It’d be so nice to see Levi and Riley play together out in your backyard—they get along well. Ill send the email today and see if I can lock in one of your proposed dates. 

And how sweet is the New Year’s Day arvo idea at your place? Let’s get that going. A family New Year’s Day sounds perfect, and it’ll be such a nice way to stay connected after spending five nights together.

I knew you had those thermals. Lucky I still keep my backup holy ones, but Levi saw them today and told me I should get a new pair. lol. Poor thing he doesn't need to see all that junk.

Looking forward to seeing you tonight - it’s so great that we’re upping the ante with socialising while still keeping our sweet little bubble, which I know will always be there for us.

Plans for tonight are sorted—Lara will pop in after dinner between 6:30 and 7:00, and they’ll head off around 8:00. Just a quick catch-up for an hour or so. Come around around 6 if you like? - with love heart cookie cutter in tow.❤️
Levi told me he was excited about his day, knowing that we will have friends around tonight. He listed them all!

Sweet Nathan xx",,

Being direct felt a million times better than turning 🤐 mute. I realise it’s nothing shameful in any way to express my discomfort. 

Really excited about all our plans and trying to dream up even more! I genuinely feel excited to catch up with Lara and get to know her better.

I absolutely love your idea! Going to Monopoly Dreams sounds like a blast and could be such a fun, interactive experience for everyone. Maybe we could plan for next weekend or during the school holidays? Levi was already excited about Monopoly, especially with the idea of munching on some fortune cookies! 😂

No worries about Monopoly today. I decided to give the iPad a refresh and set up an iCloud account just for Levi, so he can send his own messages. Now I can keep my phone secure again, ready for any cheeky messages from 'Beastie' to his word mistress! 😉 😈

We're just going to have a chill day at home, and I seriously need it. I’ve been pretty wound up and am looking forward to some TLC from you tonight. Maybe even a bit of naughty fun and relaxation if im lucky. 🤞

Can't wait to see you soon! xx",,

Maybe Levi could bring Monopoly on Tuesday night … for after dinner or an early morning game. I know it was Romy’s bday on Wednesday so maybe even if you need some time and space to yourself I could play with Levi. 

That’s great Levi has his own account now . I look forward to some Beastie word magic😈 in our now adult only space.

Did  a bit of research… we can take a direct bus from the airport to Queenstown city for 10 bucks. It’s a 30 minute ride then a 10 minute walk to hotel. Buses arrive every 15 minutes.

As for our flight it does leave at 9 am so we should probs leave around 5 ish am to factor in shuttle from long term car park .

The morning sun warmed the bay so bright,
Yet we felt the world, each sound, each light.
The crowded café, its energy loud,
The Muzak harmed, a dissonant cloud.
By the sea, it whispered, “Hotel lobby charm,”
A juxtaposition on the bay’s calm.
Claustrophobic walls and patrons near,
Till we found the balcony, calm and clear.
In our cozy corner, the world felt right,
We spoke of our plans in the soft morning light.
Of futures unfolding, of dreams to come true,
In that quiet moment, it was just me and you.
From there we wandered, the bay our guide,
Leaving the noise and the world behind.
Our steps found rhythm, the morning kind,
As peace returned, your hand in mine.
At the lover’s bench, the stillness grew,
The sun on our backs, the bay in view.
I touched the soft curve of your neck with care,
And time dissolved in the quiet air.

Never get tired of our dates Bestie. xxx",,

The closeness we shared oblivious to all,
Unable to notice the waitress’s call. 
The crunch of tempura and silky eggplant,
Elevated by the presence of my beautiful man. 
The temperature perfect and laughs, divine,
With you in my world everything feels fine.
When it feels like we’ve reached the deepest inside,
Again we plunge further as our hearts collide!
The closeness I felt as our bodies entwined,
The elixir of always.. till our faces are lined.

To scratch his back, so gently asked,
A sweet connection, simple, true,
Of something her father used to do.
And yes, I agree, the highlight for me
Was when we made love -pure, simply free.
Missionary, with arms wrapped tight,
Stroking you gently, lost in the night.
Falling into you, melting as one,
A moment eternal, though soon it was done.
Your touch, your warmth, your soul laid bare,
A memory vivid, beyond compare.

Melanie,2024-12-16 17:45:00,,,,iMessage,Outgoing,,,Delivered,,,"Hi my beautiful Melanie,

That sounds absolutely amazing, and you sound like you’re in such a bubbly, sweet mood—I love all your emojis and how excited you are. 🥰🌈 I’m really looking forward to spending time with you and Levi tomorrow night. It’ll be so nice to be nurtured by you and looked after—something I think I really need right now.

I’ve just been feeling a bit anxious lately with so many job interviews going on. Another  6 month opportunity with Telstra’s Belong came up through the recruiter who placed me at Bunnings and Origin today, and I wouldn’t mind working there since I’ve got colleagues from Origin already in there. But honestly, the job I really want is at SEEK. I’m hoping to hear back tomorrow for an interview there ( they said they were interested in my CV last week), and ANZ might offer a second round interview soon too.

I was hoping this week would be more relaxing, but I’ve been finding it hard to switch off. I know once I get to the end of the week, it’ll feel better—especially after a relaxing night at your house with you. I really can’t wait to spend that time together.

Love you heaps,
Beastie 🥰❤️",,

We’ve had a pretty productive morning! We managed to get in and out of Chadstone before it got too hectic, which was a win. But things got a little messy at Woolies on Glen Huntly Road—a litre of olive oil smashed, and the poor staff had to call in a whole clean-up team. After adding our own bit of chaos, we’re back home now, relaxing and preparing for dinner tonight.

We’re planning a little pre-Christmas feast: lamb, mashed potatoes, and an eggplant bake just for you (or for everyone, of course). I think it’ll be really nice.

Oh, and about Marilyn—Henry loves Baileys and chocolates, and for Marilyn, maybe some fancy hand soap would be perfect.

I hope your day is going well and you’re feeling on top of things. Stay cool, and I can’t wait to see you soon.

Love,

Thank you for your unforgettable birthday visit - it still lingers in my thoughts and makes me ache to see you again. Time has passed, and I find myself longing to be in control of your body once more. I want to make you ache with desire, to make you wet and desperate for me to play with you again.

Let’s not wait any longer?  Meet me tonight at the CopyCat bar at 5:30PM. We’ll start with a drink to toast the beginning of the holidays, if you start to purr, I’ll take you upstairs to celebrate with deep love and physical intimacy.

P.S. True to my word, we did indeed reach level 6 and watch back our nakedness, it was a stunning performance,  the two of us lost in our desires to THAT final climactic scene, as my manly behind desperately fucked you on my bed and we finally came together.  Bravo! 🎬👏🏻

Thank you for the gift your body bestowed.
My mind’s now afire with thoughts of you,
And the passion of last night’s rendezvous.

In the haze of the evenings embrace,
Your alluring bodysuit, a spellbinding lace,
A vision of curves, thin and divine,
Left me drunk on desire, wholly entwined.

The way it revealed, yet kept secrets untold,
Drove me crazy, a thousand desires bold.
Each glance, a craving, each touch, a call,
For your body, my love, I desired it all.

You were poetry in motion, my wildest muse,
A masterpiece painted in sensual hues.
What we shared burned bright, a love so fine,
Forever sealed in moments clandestine.

My lace covered curves only for you ,

Never before a man so admired,
A burning passion yet warm and safe too,
Your control of our lovemaking melts me into-
Your strong arms and wrapped legs,
Where incredible love begets,
Friendship and safety and most of all, muse,
I’m sorry I forgot the word I must use! 🔥🔥🔥😈😈😈❤️❤️❤️

Happy New Year and Happy Chanukah! I hope 2025 brings you both plenty of joy and special moments with your family.

It’s been such a wonderful year getting to know Melanie. She’s not only incredibly kind and supportive but also one of the funniest people I’ve ever met. Her sharp sense of humour has been a highlight for me - it’s always there, no matter the situation, and it makes every moment with her even better. 

We just returned from an unforgettable 160km e-bike tour in New Zealand. The scenery was absolutely stunning - lush trails, crystal-clear rivers, and endless breathtaking views. Of course, it wasn’t without its challenges: scorching heat, a relentless UV index, a few navigation mishaps, and one particularly stubborn bike. But Melanie’s sharp sense of humour (and my attempts to match it) kept us laughing and moving forward, even during the tougher moments. It was the perfect blend of adventure, laughter, and shared discovery - a trip that brought us even closer together. 

The holiday may be over, but I’m already looking forward to spending more time away with Melanie. We are  currently planning our next trip to Sydney in February - with my son Levi. Hope to see you, perhaps for Shabbut dinner?

I miss you more than I was ever expecting- I’m so sad our holiday and time together is over. Not being with my most closest bestie gives my heart so much pain. I knew it would be hard but not heart wrenching like it is. 
I miss our snotty Scotty jokes. 
I miss holding onto each other on long windy Queenstown roads both quietly wondering if the bus transfer could be considered an extreme sport, I miss Cookie Monster coincidences and colourful sock escapades. I miss getting lost in a labyrinth of foreign laneways and the relief of sitting down together to eat , both appreciative of the low sensory environment. I miss scaling giant bee infested mountains and being lost with you in the middle of nowhere yet trusting I will be ok - cause I’m with you, my bestie. My home.
I miss warm evening dinners with 80’s soundtracks joking that our shared table counts as a social event for us even though “ pass the salt” was our only muttering with our new now absent “friends”.  I miss my lolly robber, my rambling ramshackling thief ! 
I miss your sweet laughing eyes , your boyish excitement, your cheeky lips, your heart and soul.  I miss your endearing gaffs like you mouthing the words “handcuffs” to me as security checked your bags. I miss all of you - I miss you more than when we parted last summer and I know the reason why.  It’s because I feel so so so sure now that we are supposed to be together. That’s what I learnt most from this holiday .  I learnt that we will keep each other safe no matter what - and that our  kindness , cups of tea and sweet desire to protect each other is something I never want to lose .  I always knew we were a special coupling but since I spent the last 7 nights with you, my heart has sealed the deal - it’s yours because it fits like a glove , like a missing piece of the puzzle. Thank you beautiful man for being my gorgeous funny friend and sensual lover.  My partner in crime, a place I can land that feels like a warm home. I can’t wait to see you soon. I love you so incredibly much it’s just crazy. Love your bestie xx ❤️❤️",,

After some research I have found a place in Cheltenham where we could have our first private lesson this Saturday at 345 pm ( latest available) . Or if that’s a bit too soon the next available we could both do is sat 1st feb at 3.45 pm.

The dancing Mwahs🕺 💃 have faced their first big hurdle with Teacher Simon quitting before they even got started - such a scandal in the dancing world news. Melanie Mwah has been reported to be rebooking  with an alternative organisation- Betrayal  and Suspense is all part of their international dancing career. With not even a step to their name, and potentially 2 left feet, Melanie and Nathan Mwah have launched themselves onto the stage with a shaky start .  But behold these two dancing mwhas - whether or not they can dance does not matter - it’s their persistence to find a first lesson that will earn them a medal .

So here’s the thing, my darling Mwah: whether or not we have the perfect steps or the right teacher doesn’t matter. The beauty of the tango lies in the energy we bring to the embrace, the way we listen to each other, and the feelings we express through even the simplest movements assigned to us. With every step we take - no matter how clumsy or graceful - it’ll be a reflection of us, of our persistence, humor, and connection. So let the world watch as the Dancing Mwahs embrace the stage, bringing heart, passion, and maybe even a little “Frank” to the floor. 💃🥇🕺 Just keep him away from the Scottish dancing! 😂 (Watch to the end…)

I miss you more than I ever imagined and ache for the tender, domestic moments we shared—shopping for socks and underwear, carrying your luggage to make things easier, or quietly watching as you brushed your hair with such graceful strokes.  And they were there all the way to the end back in your loving haven in Caulfield, as we created a soft landing together—making dinner side by side, working as a team to craft a spectacular home-cooked meal. To the final, sweetest touch , lovingly washed and folded clothes before reluctantly sending me back to my family.

I miss how effortlessly we can fall into the pages of a romantic novel, like that night in the candlelit bath of our European-styled boutique hotel. Giving you my first massage during our escape, your back leaning into me, felt so intimate. The way you melted into my arms, so safe and trusting, made my heart ache with love. A cool breeze through the French doors and the Remarkables Mountains beyond framed the magic, but the real beauty was you and the love we shared in our perfect world for that brief moment.

I miss our shared humour more than I can express—the way we effortlessly bounce off each other with jokes and playful banter that no one else could ever quite understand. It’s in the little things, like those inside jokes that pop up out of nowhere, finding humour even in the most mundane or challenging moments, turning them into something uniquely ours. With you, every laugh feels deeper, more connected, and it’s that shared joy that makes being with you so wonderfully light and effortless.

I miss our shared ability to forgive, to repair, and to grow stronger when things go wrong. With you, mistakes don’t feel like failures—they’re simply steps toward deeper understanding. Your willingness to be open to new things, even when they don’t always turn out as planned, is something I admire endlessly. It’s through those moments of uncertainty that we find new doors opening, teaching us more about each other and how we face life’s challenges together. 

Most of all, I miss stepping into a world where everything just makes sense. Two INFJs together (most likely autistic and aspey lol)—it’s like our minds and hearts are tuned to the same frequency, always understanding each other without needing to explain. We notice the little things, like the energy of a place, and somehow we both just know when it’s right (or very wrong!). With you, everything flows so naturally - sharing food, finding the perfect quiet moment to recharge, or simply walking side by side, content in our shared silence. Being with you feels like the world slows down just for us, because you’re my compass, my calm, my everything.

Thank you, my beautiful woman, for being my brilliant, soulful friend and the love of my life. My partner in adventure, fellow problem solver and high achiever, my safe harbour. I can’t wait to hold you again and again, to laugh with you, and to keep building this incredible life together. I love you more than words could ever express, my darling Bestie. 

My heart has sealed the deal too my love,  always yours, forever. ❤️🤝❤️",,

Your message was exactly what I needed—it made me smile so much. It has really helped me get excited about this new role. It’s a lot to juggle right now with the school holidays and work, but I’m pulling together all the resources I can. I’ve managed to secure a new nanny for six hours a week, every Thursday afternoon in January, and I’m feeling good about that. Plus, Camilla shared her sitter’s details today, so I might have some extra help lined up soon. A Levi hang with you on Wednesday starting early would be good if that option is still available? BTW Hearing your sweet voice while you were chatting to him was so soothing, thank you for that.

I’ve just sent you an email with my thoughts on your diligent research for Sydney. You’ve done such a great job so far! If we jump on those flights soon, we’ll lock in some great deals. I also had a bit of lateral thinking about the first night—what do you think about staying at Taronga Zoo? And I sent a budget-friendly option for the second night after we say good bye to Levi at Mums. Love the Hughenden and it definitely has our stamp on it now. 💟

I love you endlessly and am so grateful for your support. Thank you for being you, my beautiful bestie.

Love always, the click to your clack,

I was just thinking about our plans for next Saturday night, the 25th. Can you remind me what time the photography exhibition starts? I’m really looking forward to it! I know I initially suggested we stay in a hotel that night, but I had another idea. How about I take you out to dinner instead? There's a fabulous Lebanese restaurant in Carlton that's kind of an institution. I haven’t been there in years, but I remember loving it, and it could be the perfect setting for us. They have a fantastic vegetarian menu, which I know you’ll appreciate, as well as some delicious meat dishes for me. The place has a very cosy, homely vibe - just the sort of spot we both enjoy.

As much as I like the idea of a hotel stay, I find that there aren’t many places in Melbourne that really capture my heart. Except, of course, for this charming little nest on Gardenvale Road that I go to. They have the most welcoming host and a wonderful bed-turn-down service that's always accompanied by a smile.🥰

Let me know what you think, my love.",,

Here are train options from Gardenvale tonight. Please let me know which one works for you  ie pick up 4  pm for 4.08 train or pick up 4.15 for 4.28 train .

Also in the morning I thought we could still try have Brekky - we could drive towards city eg south Yarra by 8 am - see cafe below and then I would only need to leave 9.15 and you could train back from south Yarra . Or we could just stay in bed and have a coffee closer .

I wouldn’t have a clue how hot it is outside, been in the air conditioning all day with fans blowing on our faces. I've been busy with work, and Levi has been coding away on Scratch all day! I love the idea of heading down to the beach later after 8 o'clock; it’s going to cool down a lot. But it’s totally up to you if you have the energy for it. I completely understand if it’s been a big day for you. I hope you’ve had fun getting your iPad fixed and are on top of your admin tasks. We’re kicking goals over here too! 😘 ☀️ 🫠",,
