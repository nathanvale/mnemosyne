/*
 * Archived: Original Pattern-Based Security Tests
 *
 * These tests were removed because we replaced inferior pattern-based security detection
 * with Claude's superior security analysis through the pr-review-synthesizer sub-agent.
 *
 * Original test coverage included:
 * - SQL injection pattern detection
 * - XSS vulnerability detection
 * - Hardcoded secrets detection
 * - OWASP Top 10 categorization
 * - SANS Top 25 mapping
 * - CWE classification
 *
 * This functionality is now provided by Claude's security analysis, which offers:
 * - More comprehensive vulnerability detection
 * - Context-aware security analysis
 * - Lower false positive rates
 * - Expert-level security insights
 * - Real-time threat intelligence
