# 🎪 Pitch: Docusaurus Documentation Site

## 🎯 Problem

Mnemosyne's documentation is scattered across multiple markdown files that developers must navigate manually, creating significant friction for onboarding and daily development work. The current setup offers no search, poor discoverability, and requires manual effort to keep documentation synchronized with rapidly evolving packages.

More critically, the documentation doesn't leverage our sophisticated Turborepo infrastructure, missing opportunities for intelligent caching and automatic updates that could make documentation maintenance effortless while providing sub-5-second developer feedback loops.

This documentation friction slows down feature development, reduces code quality, and creates barriers for new team members joining the project.

## 🍃 Appetite

- **Time Investment**: 3-4 weeks
- **Team Size**: Solo developer with periodic team feedback
- **Complexity**: Medium (Turborepo integration adds sophistication)

If this takes longer than 4 weeks, we'll **cut scope** by removing advanced features like auto-generated API docs or search integration, not extend the timeline.

## 🎨 Solution

### Core Functionality

A modern Docusaurus documentation site that treats documentation as a first-class citizen in our Turborepo monorepo, featuring:

- **Lightning-fast builds**: Sub-5-second rebuilds through intelligent caching and dependency tracking
- **Automatic updates**: Documentation rebuilds whenever `@studio/*` packages change
- **Searchable interface**: Find any piece of documentation instantly
- **GitHub Pages deployment**: Team-accessible documentation at a permanent URL
- **Mermaid diagrams**: Architecture documentation with interactive diagrams

### What It Looks Like

**For Developers:**

- Run `pnpm docs:dev` → Live documentation site in <10 seconds
- Modify any package → Documentation updates automatically
- Search "logger API" → Instantly find relevant documentation across packages
- View architecture diagrams → Interactive Mermaid diagrams render natively

**For Team:**

- Visit `https://nathanvale.github.io/mnemosyne/` → Always-current documentation
- Browse by feature, package, or architecture component
- Follow cross-references between related documentation sections

## 🏗️ How It Works

### Key Components

1. **@studio/docs Package**: Docusaurus app in `apps/docs` following monorepo conventions
2. **Enhanced Turborepo Integration**: Sophisticated dependency tracking and caching
3. **Content Pipeline**: Automated transformation of source `docs/` to Docusaurus format
4. **GitHub Actions Deployment**: Optimized build and deployment workflow

### Technical Approach

- **Architecture**: Docusaurus static site generator with React components
- **Packages Affected**: New `@studio/docs`, enhanced root `turbo.json`
- **New Dependencies**: `@docusaurus/core`, `@docusaurus/theme-mermaid`, `gh-pages`
- **Performance**: Leverages Turborepo's caching for <5s incremental builds

## 📋 Scope

### ✅ This Cycle

- [ ] **Docusaurus Setup**: Basic site with optimized Turborepo integration
- [ ] **Content Migration**: All existing `docs/` content transformed and accessible
- [ ] **Mermaid Support**: Architecture diagrams render correctly in documentation
- [ ] **GitHub Pages**: Automated deployment with team-accessible URL
- [ ] **Performance Optimization**: <5s incremental builds, 90%+ cache hit rate
- [ ] **README Clarity**: Root README clearly explains documentation structure and access
- [ ] **Agent Guidance**: CLAUDE.md updated with documentation workflow for development agents

### ❌ Not This Cycle

- Advanced theming beyond Docusaurus defaults
- Search integration (Algolia) - can add in future cycle
- Auto-generated API documentation from TypeScript
- Blog functionality for project updates
- Custom plugins or complex documentation features

### 🚫 No-Gos

- Complete documentation redesign or content rewriting
- Integration with external documentation systems
- Complex custom React components for documentation
- Advanced analytics or user tracking

## 🛠️ Implementation Plan

### Week 1: Foundation & Turborepo Integration

- [ ] Create `apps/docs` with basic Docusaurus setup
- [ ] Configure enhanced `turbo.json` with docs-specific tasks
- [ ] Set up GitHub Actions workflow for deployment
- [ ] Add Mermaid support for architecture diagrams

### Week 2: Content Migration & Navigation

- [ ] Transform existing `docs/` content to Docusaurus format
- [ ] Configure sidebar navigation matching current structure
- [ ] Test cross-references and internal linking
- [ ] Validate Mermaid diagrams render correctly

### Week 3: Performance & Integration

- [ ] Optimize Turborepo caching for documentation builds
- [ ] Implement package change detection for auto-rebuilds
- [ ] Performance testing and cache efficiency validation
- [ ] End-to-end deployment testing

### Week 4: Polish & Launch

- [ ] Final navigation and content refinement
- [ ] Team onboarding and workflow documentation
- [ ] Performance monitoring and feedback collection
- [ ] Documentation site launch announcement

## 🎯 Success Metrics

- **Functional**: All existing documentation accessible via searchable web interface
- **Performance**: <5 second incremental builds, <30 second cold builds
- **User Experience**: Team adopts documentation site as primary reference within 2 weeks
- **Technical**: 90%+ cache hit rate during development, zero manual deployment steps

## 🚨 Risks

### Technical Risks

- **Risk**: Turborepo integration becomes overly complex
  - **Mitigation**: Start simple, add optimizations incrementally

- **Risk**: Content migration breaks existing cross-references
  - **Mitigation**: Automated link checking and gradual migration with validation

### Scope Risks

- **Risk**: Feature creep into advanced documentation features
  - **Mitigation**: Strict adherence to core scope, defer enhancements to future cycles

## 🔄 Circuit Breaker

If we encounter:

- **Turborepo optimization taking more than 1 week** to achieve target performance
- **Content migration requiring major restructuring** beyond simple transformation
- **GitHub Pages deployment issues** that can't be resolved in 2 days

Then we'll **stop**, reassess, and either:

- Cut advanced performance optimizations, ship with basic Docusaurus setup
- Use simpler deployment strategy (manual builds)
- Reduce content migration scope to core documentation only

## 📦 Package Impact

- **@studio/docs**: New package containing Docusaurus application
- **Root `turbo.json`**: Enhanced with docs tasks and dependency tracking
- **GitHub Actions**: New workflow for automated documentation deployment
- **All `@studio/*` packages**: Documentation rebuilds when these change

## 🎪 Demo Plan

### Scenario

New developer joining the team needs to understand the logging architecture and implement a new feature using the dual logging system.

### Data

Real Mnemosyne codebase with current documentation and architecture diagrams.

### Flow

1. **Discovery**: Developer visits documentation site and searches "logging"
2. **Architecture**: Reviews dual logging architecture with interactive Mermaid diagrams
3. **Implementation**: Follows package documentation to implement feature
4. **Validation**: Sees their implementation approach matches documented patterns
