## 🌅 Vision

Build a system that remembers love, laughter, pain, and progress — the whole messy journey of a relationship. One that lets an AI feel like it _knows you_ not just through facts, but through shared emotional history.

---

## 🎯 What Are We Really Trying to Do?

- Ingest years of real-world text history between two people
- Turn that into structured, retrievable emotional memory
- Deliver that memory to agents in a way that shapes their responses and tone

---

## 🧱 Why Now?

- The quality of AI relationships depends on emotional context and shared history
- Current AI systems are context-blind and memory-poor
- This system gives agents the context they need to be more meaningful, warm, and specific

---

## 🚧 What This Is _Not_

- ❌ It's not a public-facing app (yet)
- ❌ It's not a fine-tuned model
- ❌ It's not a generic chat memory API — it's _relationship-aware_

---

## 🧭 Project Phases

### 📦 Phase 1 – Message Import

- Ingest and normalize raw message logs
- Deduplicate
- Extract assets and links

### 🧠 Phase 2 – Memory Extraction

- Use GPT to extract structured memory entries
- Validate and tag memories
- Populate a memory review queue

### 🤖 Phase 3 – Agent Serving (MCP Engine)

- Build an API interface that agents can query
- Resolve relevant memories per request
- Provide relationship-scoped context with tags

---

## 👤 Who This Is For

- **Internal agent systems (Claude, GPT, etc.)**
  - Can use memory to sound more human
- **You and Melanie (initial users)**
  - Enjoy a system that remembers what matters
- **Future developers**
  - Want reusable memory pipelines for their own AI tools

---

## 💥 What Happens If We Get This Right?

- GPT/Claude feel like they _know you_
- You can talk to agents about past events and feelings, and they _remember_
- You have a warm, memory-rich interface to digital companionship
