# Component Architecture for Reusable Claude Code Sub-Agent Packages

## Core package design enables rapid agent development

The foundation of a successful agent ecosystem rests on **agents-core**, a comprehensive base package providing essential building blocks that specialized agents can extend. This architecture combines TypeScript's type safety with functional composition patterns, creating a system that's both flexible and maintainable at scale. The core package serves as the single source of truth for agent behavior patterns, infrastructure utilities, and cross-cutting concerns like logging and error handling.

Modern AI agent systems require careful balance between standardization and flexibility. By establishing clear boundaries between core functionality and specialized extensions, the architecture enables teams to build domain-specific agents while maintaining consistency across the ecosystem. The approach draws inspiration from successful frameworks like NestJS and the microservice architectures of Netflix and Uber, adapting their patterns for the unique requirements of Claude Code agents.

## Agents-core package provides extensible foundations

The core package architecture centers on a **modular, composable design** that favors functional programming patterns over deep inheritance hierarchies. Base agent implementations use factory functions combined with dependency injection, enabling loose coupling between components:

```typescript
// Core Agent Interface with streaming support
interface Agent {
  name: string
  instructions: string
  model: LanguageModelInterface
  tools: Record<string, Tool>
  processQuery(query: string): AsyncGenerator<Message>
}

// Factory pattern for agent creation
export function createAgent(config: AgentConfig): Agent {
  const { llm, toolExecutor, memory } = config.dependencies

  return {
    processQuery: async function* (query: string) {
      // Agent loop with real-time streaming
      const context = await memory.retrieve(query)
      const response = await llm.generate(query, context)

      for await (const chunk of response) {
        yield processChunk(chunk, toolExecutor)
      }
    },
  }
}
```

The **XML prompt engineering framework** provides template inheritance and composition capabilities. This system enables prompt reuse across agent types while allowing specialization through template extension. Templates support variable interpolation, conditional blocks, and fragment composition:

```typescript
export class SystemPromptTemplate extends PromptTemplate {
  protected templateXML = `
    <system>
      <role>{{role}}</role>
      <capabilities>
        {{#each tools}}
        <tool name="{{name}}">{{description}}</tool>
        {{/each}}
      </capabilities>
      <constraints>
        <constraint>{{constraint}}</constraint>
      </constraints>
    </system>
  `

  protected extends = 'base-agent-template'
}
```

**MCP server management utilities** handle the complexity of connecting to various external services. The system supports multiple transport protocols (stdio, HTTP, WebSocket) and provides automatic connection pooling, health checking, and circuit breaker patterns for fault tolerance:

```typescript
export class MCPServerManager {
  private servers: Map<string, MCPServer> = new Map()

  async registerServer(serverConfig: MCPServerConfig): Promise<void> {
    const server = await this.createServer(serverConfig)
    await server.initialize()
    this.servers.set(serverConfig.name, server)
  }

  async executeToolCall(
    serverName: string,
    toolName: string,
    args: any,
  ): Promise<any> {
    const server = this.servers.get(serverName)
    if (!server) throw new Error(`Server '${serverName}' not found`)

    return await this.withCircuitBreaker(() => server.callTool(toolName, args))
  }
}
```

The **monitoring and observability system** integrates OpenTelemetry for distributed tracing, structured logging, and metrics collection. Every agent action generates telemetry data that flows through a unified pipeline, enabling end-to-end visibility across multi-agent workflows. Health checks run continuously, monitoring agent readiness and system resource utilization.

## Component reusability through mixins and plugins

The architecture employs **TypeScript mixins** to enable horizontal composition of agent capabilities. Unlike traditional inheritance, mixins create a directed acyclic graph of functionality that agents can selectively incorporate. Common capabilities like logging, retry logic, rate limiting, and caching become reusable units:

```typescript
// Advanced mixin pattern with type safety
export type AnyConstructor<A = object> = new (...input: any[]) => A

export const Retryable = <T extends AnyConstructor<object>>(base: T) =>
  class Retryable extends base {
    protected async withRetry<R>(
      operation: () => Promise<R>,
      maxRetries = 3,
    ): Promise<R> {
      let lastError: Error

      for (let i = 0; i < maxRetries; i++) {
        try {
          return await operation()
        } catch (error) {
          lastError = error
          await this.exponentialBackoff(i)
        }
      }

      throw lastError
    }
  }

// Composition of multiple capabilities
class APIAgent extends RateLimited(Retryable(Loggable(BaseAgent))) {
  // Inherits all mixin capabilities
}
```

The **plugin architecture** follows a hook-based system inspired by Webpack and VSCode extensions. Plugins register handlers for lifecycle events, enabling runtime extensibility without modifying core agent code:

```typescript
class PluggableAgent extends BaseAgent {
  public readonly hooks = {
    beforeTask: new AsyncHook<Task>(),
    afterTask: new AsyncHook<Result>(),
    beforeExecute: new AsyncHook<Task>(),
    afterExecute: new AsyncHook<Result>(),
    error: new AsyncHook<Error>(),
  }

  use(plugin: AgentPlugin): void {
    this.plugins.push(plugin)
    plugin.apply(this)
  }
}

// Plugin implementation
class ValidationPlugin implements AgentPlugin {
  apply(agent: PluggableAgent): void {
    agent.hooks.beforeExecute.tap('validation', async (task: Task) => {
      if (!this.validateTask(task)) {
        throw new ValidationError('Task validation failed')
      }
      return task
    })
  }
}
```

**Prompt template libraries** support inheritance chains and block-based composition. Templates define override points that specialized agents can customize while preserving the base structure. The system includes a template registry for centralized management and dependency resolution.

## Specialized packages extend core functionality

The architecture defines clear patterns for how **specialized agent packages** build upon agents-core. Each package focuses on a specific domain while leveraging shared infrastructure:

```
agents-monorepo/
├── packages/
│   ├── agents-core/           # Foundation package
│   ├── agents-research/       # Research-specific extensions
│   ├── agents-dev/           # Development agent capabilities
│   ├── agents-content/       # Content generation agents
│   └── agents-enterprise/    # Enterprise features
├── shared/
│   ├── prompt-templates/     # Reusable prompts
│   ├── mcp-integrations/    # Shared MCP servers
│   └── test-utils/          # Testing utilities
└── agents/
    ├── chatbot/             # Concrete agent implementations
    └── assistant/           # Using specialized packages
```

**Research agents** extend the core with capabilities for web searching, source evaluation, and information synthesis. They incorporate specialized mixins for rate limiting search APIs, caching results, and managing research context:

```typescript
import { BaseAgent } from '@agent-org/core'
import { WebSearchable, SourceEvaluator, Summarizer } from '@agent-org/research'

class ResearchAgent extends Summarizer(
  SourceEvaluator(WebSearchable(BaseAgent)),
) {
  async executeResearch(query: ResearchQuery): Promise<ResearchResult> {
    const sources = await this.searchWeb(query)
    const evaluated = await this.evaluateSources(sources)
    return await this.synthesizeFindings(evaluated)
  }
}
```

**Development agents** add code generation, testing, and deployment capabilities. They integrate with version control systems, CI/CD pipelines, and development tools through specialized MCP servers. Content agents focus on text generation, image creation, and multimedia processing, with plugins for various content platforms and formats.

Package dependencies follow strict versioning rules. Inter-package dependencies use exact versions to ensure consistency, while external dependencies use ranges for flexibility. The configuration system supports package-specific settings that inherit from shared defaults:

```typescript
// Package-specific configuration
export interface ResearchAgentConfig extends BaseAgentConfig {
  searchEngines: SearchEngineConfig[]
  sourceEvaluation: SourceEvaluationConfig
  maxSearchResults: number
  cacheStrategy: CacheStrategy
}

// Configuration with inheritance
const config = new ConfigManager<ResearchAgentConfig>(
  './config/research-agent.json',
)
config.extends('./config/base-agent.json')
```

## Build system uses Turborepo with pnpm workspaces

The recommended build architecture combines **Turborepo for orchestration with pnpm for package management**, providing optimal performance for monorepo development. Turborepo's caching system dramatically reduces build times by reusing previous outputs when inputs haven't changed:

```json
// turbo.json configuration
{
  "pipeline": {
    "build": {
      "dependsOn": ["^build"],
      "outputs": ["dist/**", "build/**"],
      "env": ["NODE_ENV"]
    },
    "test": {
      "dependsOn": ["build"],
      "outputs": ["coverage/**"]
    },
    "deploy": {
      "dependsOn": ["test", "build"],
      "env": ["DEPLOY_ENV", "API_KEY"]
    }
  }
}
```

The **CI/CD pipeline** uses GitHub Actions with smart change detection. Only affected packages rebuild when code changes, significantly reducing deployment times:

```yaml
name: CI/CD Pipeline
on:
  push:
    branches: [main, develop]

jobs:
  build-and-test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
        with:
          fetch-depth: 2

      - uses: pnpm/action-setup@v2
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: 18
          cache: 'pnpm'

      - run: pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
      - run: pnpm turbo run build --filter=...[HEAD~1]
      - run: pnpm turbo run test --filter=...[HEAD~1]
```

**Version synchronization** uses Changesets for coordinated releases across packages. Developers create changesets describing their changes, and the system automatically calculates version bumps based on semantic versioning rules. The release process generates changelogs, updates package versions, and publishes to npm automatically.

Testing follows a **multi-layer strategy** with unit tests at the package level, integration tests across packages, and end-to-end tests for complete agent workflows. Each layer uses appropriate tools - Jest for unit tests, custom harnesses for integration tests, and Playwright for end-to-end scenarios:

```typescript
// Cross-package integration test
describe('Agent Workflow Integration', () => {
  test('research agent integrates with core services', async () => {
    const agent = new ResearchAgent({
      nlp: new NLPProcessor(),
      memory: new MemoryManager(),
      search: new WebSearchService(),
    })

    const response = await agent.executeResearch('quantum computing trends')
    expect(response.sources).toHaveLength(greaterThan(0))
    expect(response.synthesis).toBeDefined()
  })
})
```

## Developer tools enable rapid agent creation

The ecosystem provides comprehensive **developer experience tooling** starting with a Yeoman-based generator for scaffolding new agent packages. The generator creates complete project structures with pre-configured build scripts, testing setups, and documentation templates:

```bash
# Create new agent package
yo @agent-org/generator
? Package name: agents-analytics
? Package type: Specialized Agent
? Base package: agents-core
? Include MCP servers: Yes
? Testing framework: Jest
? Documentation: TypeDoc
```

**Hot-reloading capabilities** use file watchers with intelligent debouncing to automatically restart agents during development. The system preserves agent state across reloads when possible, significantly improving the development iteration cycle:

```javascript
const chokidar = require('chokidar')
const debounce = require('lodash.debounce')

const reloadAgent = debounce(async (filePath) => {
  console.log(`Reloading agent: ${filePath}`)
  await preserveAgentState()
  await restartAgentProcess()
  await restoreAgentState()
  notifyDevelopers('reload-complete')
}, 300)

chokidar.watch('src/**/*').on('change', reloadAgent)
```

**Documentation generation** combines TypeDoc for API documentation with Docusaurus for guides and tutorials. The system automatically generates documentation from TypeScript types and JSDoc comments, maintaining synchronized documentation across package versions:

```javascript
// docusaurus.config.js
module.exports = {
  plugins: [
    [
      'docusaurus-plugin-typedoc-api',
      {
        projectRoot: path.join(__dirname, '..'),
        packages: ['packages/core', 'packages/research'],
        typedocOptions: {
          excludePrivate: true,
          excludeProtected: true,
        },
      },
    ],
  ],
}
```

The **template gallery** provides starter templates for common agent patterns - basic agents, multi-agent systems, web scraping agents, API integration agents, and ML-powered agents. Each template includes working code, configuration files, and deployment scripts. A VSCode extension enhances the development experience with syntax highlighting for agent configurations, debugging support, and integrated testing.

## Agent Location Management: User vs Project Level

The architecture supports Claude Code's **dual-location agent system** where agents can exist at both user (`~/.claude/agents/`) and project (`.claude/agents/`) levels. This enables powerful inheritance and override patterns:

```typescript
class AgentLocationManager {
  private userAgentsPath = path.join(os.homedir(), '.claude', 'agents')
  private projectAgentsPath = path.join(process.cwd(), '.claude', 'agents')

  async resolveAgent(agentName: string): Promise<AgentDefinition> {
    // Project-level takes precedence over user-level
    const projectAgent = await this.loadAgent(this.projectAgentsPath, agentName)
    if (projectAgent) return projectAgent

    const userAgent = await this.loadAgent(this.userAgentsPath, agentName)
    if (userAgent) return userAgent

    throw new Error(
      `Agent '${agentName}' not found in user or project directories`,
    )
  }

  async installAgent(
    agentPackage: string,
    location: 'user' | 'project' | 'auto' = 'auto',
  ): Promise<void> {
    const targetPath =
      location === 'user'
        ? this.userAgentsPath
        : location === 'project'
          ? this.projectAgentsPath
          : this.determineOptimalLocation(agentPackage)

    await this.deployAgentPackage(agentPackage, targetPath)
  }

  private determineOptimalLocation(agentPackage: string): string {
    // Personal/generic agents go to user directory
    if (this.isPersonalAgent(agentPackage)) return this.userAgentsPath

    // Project-specific agents go to project directory
    if (this.isProjectSpecific(agentPackage)) return this.projectAgentsPath

    // Default to project for team collaboration
    return this.projectAgentsPath
  }
}
```

**Installation Strategies by Agent Type:**

```bash
# Personal workflow agents (user-level)
agents-cli install @yourorg/agents-personal --location=user

# Project-specific agents (project-level)
agents-cli install @yourorg/agents-react --location=project

# Smart detection (automatic)
agents-cli install @yourorg/agents-research  # Auto-detects optimal location
```

**Configuration Inheritance Pattern:**

```typescript
class AgentConfigResolver {
  async resolveConfig(agentName: string): Promise<AgentConfig> {
    const baseConfig = await this.loadUserConfig(agentName)
    const projectOverrides = await this.loadProjectConfig(agentName)

    return {
      ...baseConfig,
      ...projectOverrides,
      // Merge arrays and objects intelligently
      tools: [...(baseConfig?.tools || []), ...(projectOverrides?.tools || [])],
      prompts: this.mergePrompts(
        baseConfig?.prompts,
        projectOverrides?.prompts,
      ),
    }
  }
}
```

## Cross-package communication uses event-driven patterns

Agent communication across packages follows **asynchronous messaging patterns** inspired by microservice architectures. The system supports multiple communication styles based on use case requirements:

```typescript
// Event-driven communication
class AgentEventBus {
  private subscribers = new Map<string, Set<EventHandler>>()

  publish(event: AgentEvent): void {
    const handlers = this.subscribers.get(event.type) || new Set()
    handlers.forEach((handler) => {
      this.executeWithCircuitBreaker(() => handler(event))
    })
  }

  subscribe(eventType: string, handler: EventHandler): void {
    if (!this.subscribers.has(eventType)) {
      this.subscribers.set(eventType, new Set())
    }
    this.subscribers.get(eventType).add(handler)
  }
}
```

**Service discovery** enables agents to locate and communicate with other agents dynamically. The registry maintains agent availability, capabilities, and health status:

```typescript
class AgentRegistry {
  private agents = new Map<string, AgentMetadata>()
  private healthChecker = new HealthChecker()

  async discoverAgent(capability: string): Promise<AgentReference> {
    const candidates = this.findAgentsByCapability(capability)
    const healthy = await this.healthChecker.filterHealthy(candidates)
    return this.loadBalancer.select(healthy)
  }
}
```

**State management** follows distributed patterns with event sourcing for audit trails and CRDT (Conflict-free Replicated Data Types) for eventually consistent shared state. The architecture supports both synchronous request-response patterns and asynchronous event streaming, choosing the appropriate pattern based on consistency requirements and latency constraints.

For **enterprise deployments**, the system includes governance layers with policy engines, compliance monitoring, and security controls. Every agent action passes through validation chains that enforce organizational policies, regulatory requirements, and security boundaries. Audit logs capture complete interaction histories with cryptographic signatures for tamper detection.

## Migration from monoliths follows proven patterns

Organizations transitioning from monolithic agent systems can adopt the **Strangler Fig pattern** for gradual migration. This approach routes requests to new microservices when available while falling back to the monolith for unmigrated functionality:

```typescript
class StranglerFigRouter {
  constructor(
    private monolith: MonolithicAgent,
    private services: Map<string, SpecializedAgent>,
  ) {}

  async handleRequest(request: AgentRequest): Promise<AgentResponse> {
    const capability = this.identifyCapability(request)

    if (this.services.has(capability)) {
      // Route to new specialized agent
      return await this.services.get(capability).process(request)
    }

    // Fallback to monolith
    return await this.monolith.process(request)
  }
}
```

**Data migration** follows a four-phase approach: dual write to both systems, dual read with comparison, gradual data movement, and cleanup of legacy dependencies. Feature flags enable runtime switching between implementations, allowing safe rollback if issues arise. The migration toolkit includes automated testing harnesses that compare outputs between old and new systems, ensuring functional parity.

**Performance optimization** patterns from industry leaders guide the scaling strategy. Netflix's circuit breaker patterns prevent cascading failures, Spotify's squad model organizes development teams, and Uber's domain-oriented architecture informs service boundaries. The system implements multi-level caching, connection pooling, and batch processing to handle high-throughput scenarios efficiently.

## Conclusion

This component architecture for reusable Claude Code sub-agent packages provides a production-ready foundation that balances standardization with flexibility. The agents-core package establishes consistent patterns while specialized packages extend functionality for specific domains. Modern build tools and comprehensive developer experience features enable rapid development and deployment.

The architecture's strength lies in its **composable design** - teams can mix and match capabilities through mixins, add functionality via plugins, and customize behavior through configuration. The event-driven communication patterns and distributed state management approaches ensure the system scales horizontally while maintaining consistency. Enterprise features like governance layers and security controls make the architecture suitable for regulated environments.

By following established microservice patterns and learning from successful implementations at Netflix, Spotify, and Uber, this architecture provides a **robust foundation for building sophisticated agent ecosystems**. The migration patterns enable gradual adoption, allowing organizations to transition from monolithic systems without disrupting operations. The result is a flexible, maintainable, and scalable platform for Claude Code agent development.
